<div class="maintitle">STORIES FROM THE TRENCHES</div>

<h2>THE MAN WHO “CAME BACK”</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE of the strangest of the many personal romances
which the war has brought is the tale of a man
who, dismissed from the British Army by court martial,
redeemed himself through service with that most heterogeneous
of organizations, the French Foreign Legion.
His name was John F. Elkington, and he had held an
honored post for more than thirty years. Then, just
as his regiment, in the closing months of 1914, was
going into the fighting on the Western front, he was
cashiered for an unrevealed error and deprived of the
opportunity to serve his country.</p>

<p>Heavy with disgrace, he disappeared, and for a long
time no one knew what had become of him. Some even
went so far as to surmise that he had committed suicide,
until finally he turned up as an enlisted soldier in the
Foreign Legion. In their ranks he went into the conflict
to redeem himself. Today, says the New York <i>Herald</i>,
he is back in England. He will never fight again, for he
has practically lost the use of his knees from wounds.
But he is perhaps the happiest man in England, and the
account tells why, explaining:</p>

<p>Pinned on his breast are two of the coveted honors of
France—the Military Medal and the Military Cross—but
most valued possession of all is a bit of paper which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
obliterates the errors of the past—a proclamation from
the official London <i>Gazette</i> announcing that the King has
“graciously approved the reinstatement of John Ford
Elkington in the rank of lieutenant-colonel, with his
previous seniority, in consequence of his gallant conduct
while serving in the ranks of the Foreign Legion of the
French Army.”</p>

<p>Not only has Colonel Elkington been restored to the
Army, but he has been reappointed in his old regiment,
the Royal Warwickshires, in which his father served
before him.</p>

<p>In the same London <i>Gazette</i>, at the end of October,
1914, had appeared the crushing announcement that
Elkington had been cashiered by sentence of general
court martial. What his error was did not appear at the
time, and has not been alluded to in his returned hour
of honor. It was a court martial at the front at a time
when the first rush of war was engulfing Europe and
little time could be wasted upon an incident of that sort.
The charge, it is now stated, did not reflect in any way
upon the officer’s personal courage.</p>

<p>But with fallen fortunes he passed quietly out of the
Army and enlisted in the Legion—that corps where
thousands of brave but broken men have found a shelter,
and now and then an opportunity to make themselves
whole again.</p>

<p>Colonel Elkington did not pass unscathed through fire.
His fighting days are ended. His knees are shattered
and he walks heavily upon two sticks.</p>

<p>“They are just fragments from France,” he said of
those wounded knees, and smiled in happy reminiscence
of all they meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is wonderful to feel,” said Colonel Elkington,
“that once again I have the confidence of my King and
my country. I am afraid my career in the field is
ended, but I must not complain.”</p>

<p>Colonel Elkington made no attempt to cloak his name
or his former Army service when he entered the ranks
of the Legion.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I be a private?” he asked. “It is an
honor for any man to serve in the ranks of that famous
corps. Like many of the other boys, I had a debt to pay.
Now it is paid.”</p>

<p>The press of London is unanimous in welcoming the
old soldier back into his former rank. One of them, <i>The
Evening Standard</i>, contains the account of how he went
about enlisting for France when he saw he would best
leave London. It is written by a personal friend of
Colonel Elkington, with all the vividness and sympathy
of an actual observer of the incidents detailed. We are
told:</p>

<p>“Late in October, 1914, I met him, his Army career
apparently ruined. He had told the truth, which told
against him; but in the moment when many men would
have sunk, broken and despairing, he bore himself as he
was and as he is today, a very gallant gentleman. He
had been cashiered and dismissed from the service for
conduct which, in the judgment of the court martial,
rendered him unfit and incapable of serving his sovereign
in the future in any military capacity. The London
<i>Gazette</i> came out on October 14, 1914, recording the
fact, and it became known to his many friends. For
over thirty years he had served, and for distinguished
service wore the Queen’s medal with four clasps after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the Boer War. He went to France with the Royal Warwickshire
Regiment at the outbreak of this conflict. His
chance had come after twenty-eight years.”</p>

<p>During the first terrible two months he had done
splendid work. A moment sufficient to try the discretion
of any officer arrived. He made his mistake. He told
his story to the general court martial. He vanished—home;
and the London <i>Gazette</i> had the following War-Office
announcement:</p>

<p>“Royal Warwickshire Regiment.—Lieutenant-Colonel
John F. Elkington is cashiered by sentence of a general
court martial. Dated September 14, 1914.”</p>

<p>He recognized at once, as he sat with me, what this
meant. We chatted about various projects, and at last
he said, “There is still the Foreign Legion. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>Being acquainted with it, I told him what I knew; how
it was the “refuge” for men of broken reputations; how
it contained Italians, Germans, Englishmen, Russians,
and others who had broken or shattered careers; the way
to set about joining it by going to the recruiting office at——;
how the only requirement was physical fitness;
that no questions would be asked; that I doubted if he
would like all his comrades; that the discipline was
very severe; that he might be sent to Algiers; that he
would find all kinds of men in this flotsam—men of
education and culture, perhaps scoundrels and blackguards
as well; but he would soon discover perfect
discipline.</p>

<p>Now for a man of his age to smile as he did, to set out
on the bottom rung of the ladder as a ranker in a strange
army, among strangers, leaving all behind him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
held dear, was a great act of moral courage. We heard
of him at intervals, but such messages as dribbled
through to his friends were laconic. We heard also he
had been at this place and that, and that he was well and
apparently doing well. That he had been repeatedly in
serious action of recent months we also knew, and then
came the news that he had won the coveted <i>Médaillé
Militaire</i>—and more, that it was for gallant service. A
curious distinction it is in some ways. Any meritorious
service may win it; but not all ranks can get it. A
<i>generalissimo</i> like General Joffre or Sir Douglas Haig
may wear it for high strategy and tactics, and a non-commissioned
officer or private may win and wear it for
gallantry or other distinction. But no officer below a
<i>generalissimo</i> can gain it. This distinction Elkington
won. We all felt he had made good in the Legion, where
death is near at all times, and we waited.</p>

<p>Today’s <i>Gazette</i> announcement has given all who
knew him the greatest pleasure. He has told none of
them for what particular act he received the coveted
medal—just like Jack Elkington’s modesty.</p>

<p>But, as soon as he arrived home in England, the interviewers
went after him hot and heavy. He found it all
very boresome, for, now that the affair was over, he
could see no use in talking about it to everybody. A
reporter for <i>The Daily Chronicle</i>, however, managed to
get what is probably the most satisfactory interview with
him and one which shows to best advantage the peculiar
psychology of this man who has experienced so many
different sides of life. The interviewer, in telling of
their conversation, portrays the Colonel as saying:</p>

<p>“Complaint? Good Lord, no! The whole thing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
my own fault. I got what I deserved, and I had no kick
against anyone. It was just ‘Carry on!’”</p>

<p>Brave words from a brave man—a man who has
proved his bravery and worth in what surely were as
heartrending circumstances as ever any man had to face.
My first sight of the Man Who Has Made Good was as
he descended the stairs, painfully and with the aid of
two sticks, into the hall of his lovely old home by the
river at Pangbourne. It is a house which the great
Warren Hastings once called home also.</p>

<p>Very genial, very content, I found the man whose
name today is on everyone’s lips; but very reticent also,
with the reticence natural to the brave man who has
achieved his aim and, having achieved it, does not wish
it talked of.</p>

<p>“And now,” I suggested, “you have again got what
you deserve?”</p>

<p>Colonel Elkington drew a long breath. “I hope so,”
he said, at length, very quietly. “I have got my name
back again, I hope cleared. That is what a man would
care for most, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“There is always a place in the Foreign Legion for
someone who is down in the world,” he told me. “Directly
after the court martial, when the result appeared in the
papers, I said I must do something; that I could not sit
at home doing nothing, and that as I could not serve
England I would serve France. Yes, I did offer my
services again to England, but it is military law that no
man who has been cashiered can be employed again for
the King while the sentence stands. So there was nothing
for it but the Foreign Legion—that home for the
fallen man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Of that strange and famous corps Colonel Elkington
cannot speak without a glint of pride in his keen blue
eyes. Splendid men, the best in the world, he calls them,
“and every one was as kind as possible to me.” Many
there were who had become legionaries because they, too,
had failed elsewhere, “lost dogs like myself,” the Colonel
called them; but the majority of the men with whom he
served were there because there was fighting to be done,
because fighting was second nature to them, and because
there was a cause to be fought for. The officers he
describes as the “nicest fellows in the world and splendid
leaders.”</p>

<p>When Colonel Elkington first joined there were many
Englishmen included in its ranks, but most of these subsequently
transferred to British regiments. He enlisted
in his own name, but none knew his story, and often he
was questioned as to his reason for not transferring—“and
I had to pitch them the tale.”</p>

<p>He kept away from British soldiers as much as possible,
“but one day someone shouted my name. I remember
I was just about to wash in a stream when a staff
motor drove by and an officer waved his hand and called
out. But I pretended not to hear and turned away....</p>

<p>“I don’t think that the men in the Legion fear anything,”
he said. “I never saw such men, and I think in
the attack at Champaigne they were perfectly wonderful.
I never saw such a cool lot in my life as when they
went forward to face the German fire then. It was a
great fight; they were all out for blood, and, though they
were almost cut up there, they got the German trenches.”</p>

<p>The time he was recognized, as detailed above, was
the only one. At no other time did any of his comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
suspect his identity, or else, if they did, they were consideration
itself in keeping it to themselves. Of this
recognition and some of his subsequent experiences, the
London <i>Times</i> remarks, speaking of its own interview
with him:</p>

<p>It was the only voice from the past that came to him,
and he took it as such. A few minutes afterward he was
stepping it out heel and toe along the dusty road, a
private in the Legion.</p>

<p>Shot in the leg, Colonel Elkington spent ten months
in hospital and eight months on his back. This was in
the Hôpital Civil at Grenoble. He could not say enough
for the wonderful treatment that was given him there.
They fought to save his life, and when they had won that
fight, they started to save his leg from amputation. The
head of the hospital was a Major Termier, a splendid
surgeon, and he operated eight times and finally succeeded
in saving the damaged limb. When he was first
in hospital neither the patients nor any of the hospital
staff knew what he was or what he had done. Elkington
himself got an inkling of his good fortune at Christmas
when he heard of his recommendation for the <i>Croix de
Guerre</i>.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that helped me to get better,” he said.
“The medals are over there on the mantelpiece.” I went
over to where there were two glass cases hanging on
the wall. “No, not those; those are my father’s and my
grandfather’s.” He showed me the medals, and on the
ribbon of the cross there was the little bronze palm-branch
which doubles the worth of the medal.</p>

<p>When he was wounded Dr. Wheeler gave him a stiff
dose of laudanum, but he lay for thirteen hours until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
saw a French patrol passing. He was then 100 yards
short of the German second line of trenches, for this
was in the Champaigne Battle, on September 28, when
the French made a magnificent advance.</p>

<p>It was difficult to get Colonel Elkington to talk about
himself. As his wife says, he has a horror of advertisement,
and a photographer who ambushed him outside his
own lodge-gates yesterday made him feel more nervous
than when he was charging for the machine gun that
wounded him. To say he was happy would be to write a
platitude. He is the happiest man in England. He is
now recuperating and receiving treatment, and he hopes
that he will soon be able to walk more than the 100 yards
that taxes his strength to the utmost at present.</p>

<h3>FOUR TO THE GOOD</h3>

<p>In times of peace Smith might have been an author
who had drifted into some useful occupation, such as
that of a blacksmith, but just now he is cook to the
Blankshire officers’ mess. Smith sent Murphy into the
village to bring home some chickens ordered for the
mess.</p>

<p>“Murphy,” said Smith, the next day, “when you
fetch me chickens again, see that they are fastened up
properly. That lot you fetched yesterday all got loose,
and though I scoured the village I only managed to
secure ten of them.”</p>

<p>“’Sh!” said Murphy. “I only brought six.”</p>

<h2>FRANCO-YANKO ROMANCES</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE story is told of a British “Tommy” who could
not make up his mind whether to acquire a farm or
a village store, by marriage, “somewhere in France.”
He could have either, but not both. Dispatches say that
the banns have already been read for some of our “Sammies,”
and when the war is over France will have some
sturdy Yankee citizens. Difference of language seems
to form no bar; in fact, the kindly efforts of each to learn
the language of the other acts as an aid. It must be said
that the British, so far, have rather the best of it. They
have beaten the Yankees to the altar of Hymen, but they
had the field to themselves for some time. By the end of
the war the Americans may have caught up, for love and
war have always walked hand in hand with Uncle Sam’s
boys. Nevertheless the British have a big start, for
Judson C. Welliver, writing to the New York <i>Sun</i> from
Paris, says that in Calais hundreds of young English
mechanics have married French girls. The writer tells
of being accosted by a young man from “the States” at
the corner of the Avenue de l’Opéra and “one of those
funny little crooked streets that run into it.” Breezily
the American introduced himself and said:</p>

<p>“Say, do you happen to know a little caffy right
around here called the—the—blame it, I can’t even
remember what that sign looked like it was trying to
spell.”</p>

<p>I admitted that the description was a trifle too vague
to fit into my geographic scheme of Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because,” he went on, “there’s a girl there that talks
United States, and she’s been waiting on me lately. I
get all the best of everything there and don’t eat anywhere
else. But this morning I took a walk and coming
from a new direction I can’t locate the place. I promised
her I’d be in for breakfast this morning.”</p>

<p>“Something nifty?” I ventured, being willing to encourage
that line of conversation. Whereat he plainly
bridled:</p>

<p>“She’s a nice girl,” he said; “family were real people
before the war. Learned to talk United States in England;
went to school there awhile. Why, she wouldn’t
let me walk home with her last night, but said maybe
she would tonight.”</p>

<p>There isn’t anybody quite so adaptable as the young
Frenchwoman. Only in the last few months has Paris
seen any considerable number of English-speaking soldiers,
because earlier in the war the British military
authorities kept their men pretty religiously away from
the alleged “temptations” of the gay capital. Later
they discovered that Paris was rather a better place than
London for the men to go.</p>

<p>So the French girls, in shops and cafés, have been
learning English recently at an astounding rate. They
began the study because of the English invasion; they
have continued it with increased zeal because since the
Americans have been coming it has been profitable.</p>

<p>To be able to say “Atta boy!” in prompt and sympathetic
response to “Ham and eggs” is worth 50 centimes
at the lowest. The capacity to manage a little casual
conversation and give a direction on the street is certain
to draw a franc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, there aren’t going to be so many men left,
after the war, in France!</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, figuring that there are a couple of million
Britishers in the country and a million or maybe
two of Americans coming, has her own views about the
prospect that the next generation Frenchwomen may be
old maids.</p>

<p>In Calais there is a big industrial establishment to
which the British military authorities have brought great
numbers of skilled mechanics to make repairs to machinery,
reconstruct the outworn war-gear, tinker obstreperous
motor-vehicles, and, in short, keep the whole
machinery and construction side of the war going. Most
of the mechanics who were sent there were young
men.</p>

<p>Calais testifies to the ability of the Frenchwomen to
make the most of their attractions. English officers tell
me that hundreds of young Englishmen settled in Calais
“for the duration” have married French girls and settled
into homes. They intend, in a large proportion of cases,
to remain there, too.</p>

<p>The same thing is going on in Boulogne, which is to
all intents and purposes nowadays as much an English
as a French port. Everywhere English is spoken and
by nobody is it learned so quickly as by the young
women.</p>

<p>Frenchwomen have always had the reputation of making
themselves agreeable to visiting men, but one is quite
astonished to learn the number of Englishmen who married
Frenchwomen even before the war. The balance is
a little imperfect, for the records show that there are not
nearly as many Frenchmen marrying English girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
But, says the writer in the <i>Sun</i>, a new generation of girls
of marriageable age has arrived with the war, and:</p>

<p>Not only in the military, industrial, and naval base
towns are the British marrying these Frenchwomen, but
even in the country nearer the front. There are incipient
romances afoot behind every mile of the trench-line.</p>

<p>Two related changes in French life are coming with
the war which make these international marriages easier.
Both relate to the <i>dot</i> [dowry] system. On the one side
there are many French girls who have lost their <i>dots</i>
and have small prospect of reacquiring the marriage
portion. To live in these strenuous times is about all
they can hope for. For these the free-handed Americans,
Canadians, and Australians look like good prospects
for a well-to-do marriage.</p>

<p>Even the British Tommy, though he enjoys no such
income as the Americans and colonials, is nevertheless
quite likely to have a bit of private income from the folks
“back in Blighty” to supplement the meager pay he
draws. The portionless French maid sees in these prosperous
young men who have come to fight for her country
not only the saviors of the nation, but a possibility of
emancipation from the <i>dot</i> system that has broken down
in these times.</p>

<p>On the other side, there are more than a few young
women in France who must be rated “good catches” to-day,
though their <i>dots</i> would have been unimportant before
the war. A girl who has inherited the little
property of her family, because father and brothers all
lie beneath the white crosses along the Marne, not infrequently
finds herself possessed of a little fortune she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
could never have expected under other conditions.
Many of these, likewise, bereft of sweethearts as well
as relatives, have been married to English and colonial
soldiers or workmen; and pretty soon we will be learning
that their partiality for America—for there is such a
partiality, and it is a decided one—will be responsible
for many alliances in that direction.</p>

<p>How it will all work out in the end is only to be
guessed at as yet. The British officers who have been
observing these Anglo-French romances for a long time
assert that the British Tommy who weds a Frenchwoman
is quite likely to settle in France; particularly if his
bride brings him a village house or a few hectares of
land in the country.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the colonials insist on taking their
French brides back to New Zealand or Canada, or wherever
it may be—India, Shanghai, somewhere in Africa—no
matter, the colonial is a colonial forever; he has no
idea of going back to the cramped conditions of England.
He likes the motherland, all right, is willing to fight for
it, but wants room to swing a bull by the tail, and that
isn’t to be had in England, he assures you.</p>

<p>Probably the Americans will be like the colonials;
those who find French wives will take them home after
the war. That a good many of them will marry French
wives can hardly be doubted.</p>

<p>Yes, the French girls like the American boys. But
there is another scene. It is that of the country billet,
which varies from a château to a cellar, the ideal one—from
the point of view of a billeting officer—being a bed
for every officer, and nice clean straw for the men. Get
this picture of “Our Village, Somewhere in France,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
back of the line, as drawn by Sterling Hielig in the Los
Angeles <i>Times:</i></p>

<p>A French valley full of empty villages, close to the
fighting line. No city of tents. No mass of shack constructions.
The village streets are empty. Geese and
ducks waddle to the pond in Main Street.</p>

<p>It is 4 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p>Bugle!</p>

<p>Up and down the valley, in the empty villages, there
is a moving-picture transformation. The streets are
alive with American soldiers—tumbling out of village
dwelling-houses!</p>

<p>Every house is full of boarders. Every village family
has given, joyfully, one, two, three of its best rooms for
the cot beds of the Americans! Barns and wagon-houses
are transformed to dormitories. They are learning
French. They are adopted by the family. Sammy’s in
the kitchen with the mother and the daughter.</p>

<p>Bugle!</p>

<p>They are piling down the main street to their own
American breakfast—cooked in the open, eaten in the
open, this fine weather.</p>

<p>In front of houses are canvas reservoirs of filtered
drinking-water. The duck pond in Main street is being
lined with cement. The streets are swept every morning.
There are flowers. The village was always picturesque.
Now it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Chaplains’ clubs are set up in empty houses. The
only large tent is that of the Y. M. C. A.; and it is
<i>camouflaged</i> against enemy observers by being painted
in streaked gray-green-brown, to melt into the colors of
the hill against which it is backed up, practically invisible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Its “canteen on wheels” is loaded with towels,
soap, razors, chocolate, crackers, games, newspapers,
novels, and tobacco. At cross-roads, little flat Y. M. C.
A. tents (painted grass and earth color) serve as stations
for swift autos carrying packages and comforts.
In them are found coffee, tea, and chocolate, ink, pens,
letter-paper, and envelopes; and a big sign reminds
Sammy that “You Promised Your Mother a Letter,
Write It Today!”</p>

<p>All decent and in order. Otherwise the men could
never have gone through the strenuous coaching for
the front so quickly and well.</p>

<p>In “Our Village,” not a duck or goose or chicken has
failed to respond to the roll call in the past forty days—which
is more than can be said of a French company
billet, or many a British.</p>

<p>Fruit hung red and yellow in the orchards till the
gathering. I don’t say the families had as many bushels
as a “good year”; but there is no criticism.</p>

<p>In a word, Sammy has good manners. He looks on
these French people with a sort of awed compassion.
“They had a lot to stand!” he whispers. And the villagers,
who are no fools (“as wily as a villager,” runs
the French proverb), quite appreciate these fine shades.
And the house dog wags his tail at the sight of khaki, as
the boys come loafing in the cool of the back yard after
midday dinner.</p>

<p>In the evening the family play cards in the kitchen,
and here no effort is necessary to induce the girls to
learn English, for, though they pretend that they are
teaching French, they are really—very slyly—“picking
up” English while they are being introduced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the mysteries of draw-poker. Says the writer in <i>The
Times:</i></p>

<p>So, it goes like this when they play poker in the
kitchen—the old French father, the pretty daughter,
the flapper girl cousin, and three roughnecks. (One
boy has the sheets of “Conversational French in Twenty
Days,” and really thinks that he is conversing—“<i>Madame</i>,
<i>mademoiselle</i>, <i>maman</i>, <i>monsieur</i>, <i>papa</i>, or
<i>mon oncle</i>, pass the buck and get busy!”)</p>

<p>“You will haf’ carts, how man-ny? (business.) Tree
carts, fife carts, ou-one cart, no cart, an’ zee dee-laire
seex carts!”—“Here, Bill, wake up!”—“Beel sleep!
<i>Avez-vous sommeil</i>, Beel?”—“<i>Oui</i>, mademoiselle, I slept
rotten last night, I mean I was <i>tray jenny pars’ke</i> that
darned engine was pumping up the duck pond—”</p>

<p>“Speak French!”—“Play cards!”—“<i>Vingt-cinq!</i>”—“<i>Et
dix!</i>” “<i>Et encore five cen-times.</i> I’m broke.
Just slip me a quarter, Wilfred, to buy <i>jet-toms!</i>” And
a sweet and plaintive voice: “I haf’ tree paire, <i>mon
oncle</i>, an’ he say skee-doo, I am stung-ed. I haf’ seex
carts!”—“Yes, you’re out of it, I’m sorry, mademoiselle.
Come up!” “Kom opp? Comment, kom opp?”</p>

<p>“Stung-ed” has become French. Thus does Sammy
enrich the language of Voltaire. His influence works
equally on pronunciation. There is a tiny French village
named Hinges—on which hinges the following.
From the days of Jeanne d’Arc, the natives have pronounced
it “Anjs,” in one syllable, with the sound of “a”
as in “ham”; but Sammy, naturally, pronounces it
“hinges,” as it is spelled, one hinge, two hinges on the
door or window. So, the natives, deeming that such
godlings can’t be wrong on any detail, go about, now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
showing off their knowledge to the ignorant, and saying,
with a point of affection: “I have been to ‘Injes!’”</p>

<p>I should not wonder if some of these boys would
marry. They might do worse. The old man owns 218
acres and nobody knows what Converted French Fives.
Sammy, too, has money. A single regiment of American
marines has subscribed for $60,000 worth of French
war-bonds since their arrival in the zone—this, in spite
of their depositing most of their money with the United
States Government.</p>

<p>Sammy sits in the group around the front door in
the twilight. Up and down the main street are a hundred
such mixed groups. Already he has found a place,
a family. He is somebody.</p>

<p>And what American lad ever sat in such a group at
such a time without a desire to sing? And little difference
does it make whether the song be sentimental or
rag; sing he must, and sing he does. The old-timers like
“I Was Seeing Nellie Home” and “Down by the Old
Mill Stream” proved to be the favorites of the listening
French girls. For they will listen by the hour to the
soldiers’ choruses. They do not sing much themselves,
for too many of their young men are dead. But, finally,
when the real war-songs arrived, they would join timidly
in the chorus, “Hep, hep, hep!” and “Slopping
Through Belgium” electrified the natives, and <i>The
Times</i> says:</p>

<p>To hear a pretty French girl singing “Epp, epp, epp!”
is about the limit.</p>

<p>Singing is fostered by the high command. Who can
estimate the influence of “Tipperary?” To me, American
civilian in Paris, its mere melody will always stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
those noble sentiments we felt as the first wounded
English came to the American Ambulance Hospital of
Neuilly. For many a year to come “Tipperary” will
make British eyes wet, when, in the witching hour of
twilight, it evokes the khaki figures in the glare of the
sky-line and the dead who are unforgotten!</p>

<p>Who can estimate, for France, the influence of that
terrible song of Verdun—“<i>Passeront pas!</i>” Or who
can forget the goose-step march to death of the Prussian
Guard at Ypres, intoning “<i>Deutschland Uber Alles!</i>”</p>

<p>“It is desired that the American Army be a singing
army!” So ran the first words of a communication
to the American public of Paris, asking for three thousand
copies of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”—noble
marching strophes of Julia Ward Howe, which 18641865
fired the hearts of the Northern armies in 1864-1865.</p>

<p class="center">
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
</p>

<p>They are heard now on the American front in France.
One regiment has adopted it “as our marching song,
in memory of the American martyrs of Liberty.” And
in Our Village, you may hear a noble French translation
of it, torn off by inspired French grandmothers!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h2>TRENCH SUPERSTITIONS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT is told in the chronicles of “The White Company”
how the veteran English archer, Samkin Aylward,
was discovered by his comrades one foggy morning
sharpening his sword and preparing his arrows and
armor for battle. He had dreamed of a red cow, he
announced.</p>

<p>“You may laugh,” said he, “but I only know that on
the night before Crécy, before Poitiers, and before the
great sea battle at Winchester, I dreamed of a red cow.
To-night the dream came to me again, and I am putting
a very keen edge on my sword.”</p>

<p>Soldiers do not seem to have changed in the last five
hundred years, for Tommy Atkins and his brother the
<i>poilu</i> have warnings and superstitions fully as strange
as Samkin’s. Some of these superstitions are the little
beliefs of peace given a new force by constant peril,
such as the notion common to the soldier and the American
drummer that it is unlucky to light three cigars with
one match; other presentiments appear to have grown
up since the war began. In a recent magazine two
poems were published dealing with the most dramatic
of these—the Comrade in White who appears after
every severe battle to succor the wounded. Dozens
have seen him, and would not take it kindly if you
suggested they thought they saw him. They are sure
of it. The idea of the “call”—the warning of impending
death—is firmly believed along the outskirts of No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Man’s Land. Let us quote some illustrations from the
Cincinnati <i>Times:</i></p>

<p>“I could give you the names of half a dozen men of
my own company who have had the call,” said Daniel W.
King, the young Harvard man, who was transferred
from the Foreign Legion to a line regiment; just in time
to go through the entire battle of Verdun. “I have
never known it to fail. It always means death.”</p>

<p>Two men were quartered in an old stable in shell-range
of the front. As they went to their quarters one
of them asked the other to select another place in which
to sleep that night. It was bitterly cold and the stable
had been riddled by previous fire, and the army blanket
under such conditions seems as light as it seems heavy
when its owner is on a route march.</p>

<p>“Why not roll up together?” said the other man.
“That way we can both keep warm.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the first man. “I shall be killed to-night.”</p>

<p>The man who had received the warning went into the
upper part of the stable, the other pointing out in utter
unbelief of the validity of a call that the lower part was
the warmer, and that if his friend were killed it would
make no difference whether his death chamber were
warm or cold. A shell came through the roof at midnight.
It was a “dud”—which is to say that it did not
explode. The man who had been warned was killed
by it. If it had exploded the other would probably
have been killed likewise. As it was he was not harmed.</p>

<p>A few days ago the chief of an aeroplane section at
the front felt a premonition of death. He was known
to all the army for his utterly reckless daring. He liked
to boast of the number of men who had been killed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of his section. He was always the first to get away on
a bombing expedition and the last to return. He had
received at least one decoration—accompanied by a
reprimand—for flying over the German lines in order
to bring down a <i>Fokker</i>.</p>

<p>“I have written my letters,” he said to his lieutenant.
“When you hear of my death, send them on.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant laughed at him. That sector of the
line was quiet, he pointed out. No German machine
had been in the air for days. He might have been
justified in his premonition, the lieutenant said, on any
day of three months past. But now he was in not so
much danger as he might be in Paris from the taxicabs.
That day a general visited the headquarters and the
chief went up in a new machine to demonstrate it.
Something broke when he was three thousand feet high
and the machine fell sidewise like a stone.</p>

<p>It is possible, say the soldiers, to keep bad fortune
from following an omen by the use of the proper talisman.
The rabbit’s foot is unknown, but it is said that
a gold coin has much the same effect—why, no one seems
to know. A rabbit’s foot, of course, must be from the
left hind leg, otherwise it is good for nothing, and
according to a <i>poilu</i> the efficacy of the gold piece depends
upon whether or no it puts the man into touch
with his “star.” It is said in the New York <i>Sun:</i></p>

<p>Gold coins are a mascot in the front lines, a superstition
not difficult to explain. It was at first believed
that wounded men on whom some gold was found would
be better looked after by those who found them, and
by degrees the belief grew up, especially among artillery,
that a gold coin was a talisman against being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
mutilated if they were taken prisoners, whether wounded
or not.</p>

<p>The Government’s appeals to have gold sent to the
Bank of France and not to let it fall into enemy hands
in case of capture has since reduced the amount of gold
at the front, but many keep some coins as a charm.
Many men sew coins touching one another in such a
way as to make a shield over the heart.</p>

<p>“Every man has his own particular star,” a Lyons
farm hand said to Apollinaire, “but he must know it.
A gold coin is the only means to put you in communication
with your star, so that its protecting virtue can
be exercised. I have a piece of gold and so am easy in
my mind I shall never be touched.” As a matter of fact
he was seriously wounded later.</p>

<p>Perhaps he lost his gold-piece!</p>

<p><i>The Sun</i> relates another story which indicates the
belief that if the man does not himself believe that he
had a true “call” he will be saved. It is possible to fool
the Unseen Powers, to pull wool over their eyes. To
dream of an auto-bus has become a token of death,
attested by the experience of at least four front-line
regiments. And yet a sergeant succeeded in saving the
life of a man who had dreamed of an auto-bus by the
use of a clever ruse—or lie, if you prefer. As the
anecdote is told in <i>The Sun:</i></p>

<p>A corporal said he had dreamed of an auto-bus.
“How can that be,” the sergeant asked, “when you
have never been to Paris or seen an auto-bus?” The
corporal described the vision. “That an auto-bus!”
declared the sergeant, although the description was perfect.
“Why, that’s one of those new machines that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
English are using. Don’t let that worry you!” He
didn’t, and lived!</p>

<p>A regiment from the south has the same belief about
an automobile lorry.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for the scientifically minded, a
disbelief in omens does not preserve the skeptic from
their consequences. On the contrary, he who flies in
the face of Providence by being the third to get a light
from one match is certain of speedy death. <i>The Sun</i>
continues:</p>

<p>Apollinaire tells how he was invited to mess with a
friend, Second Lieutenant François V——, how this
superstition was discussed and laughed at by François
V——, and how François V—— happened to be the
third to light his cigaret with the same match.</p>

<p>The morning after, François V—— was killed five
or six miles from the front lines by a German shell.
It appears that the superstition is that the death is
always of this nature, as Apollinaire quotes a captain
of a mixed <i>tirailleur</i> and <i>zouave</i> regiment as saying:</p>

<p>“It is not so much the death that follows, as death no
longer is a dread to anyone, but it has been noticed that
it is always a useless form of death. A shell splinter
in the trenches or, at best, in the rear, which has nothing
heroic about it, if there is anything in this war which
is not heroic.”</p>

<h2>IN THE TRAIL OF THE HUN</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WAR has become so much a part of the life of the
French peasants that they have little fear under
fire. Frenchmen over military age and Frenchwomen
pursue their ordinary avocations with little concern for
exploding shells. To be sure, it is something of a nuisance,
but children play while their mothers work at the tub
washing soldier clothing. And as the Allied armies
advance, wresting a mile or two of territory from the
enemy at each stroke, the peasant follows with his plow
less than a mile behind the lines. War has become a
part of their lives. Newman Flower, of <i>Cassell’s Magazine</i>,
has been “Out There,” and he thus records some
of his impressions in the trail of the war:</p>

<p>The war under the earth is a most extraordinary
thing. In the main, the army you see in the war
zone is not a combatant army. It is the army of supply.
The real fighters you seldom set eyes on unless
you go and look for them. And, generally speaking,
the ghastliness of war is carried on beneath the earth’s
level.</p>

<p>Given time, the <i>Boche</i> will take a lot of beating as
an earth delver. At one spot on the Somme I went
into a veritable underground town, where, till the British
deluge overtook them, three thousand of the toughest
Huns the Kaiser had put into his line lived and thrived.
They had sets of compartments there, these men, with
drawing-rooms complete, even to the piano, kitchen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bathroom, and electric light, and I was told that there
was one place where you could have your photograph
taken, or buy a pair of socks! Every visitor down the
steps—except the British—was required to turn a handle
three times, which pumped air into the lower regions.
If you descended without pumping down your portion
of fresh air you were guilty of bad manners.</p>

<p>Anything more secure has not been invented since
Adam. But this impregnable city fell last year, as all
things must fall before the steady pressing back of
British infantry.</p>

<p>The writer tells of discovering in an old French town
that was then under fire a shell-torn building on which
were displayed two signs reading “First Aid Post” and
“Barber Shop.” He says:</p>

<p>When I dived inside I saw one man having his arm
dressed, for he had been hit by a piece of shell in the
square, and in a chair a few yards away a Tommy
having a shave. Coming in as a stranger, I was informed
that if I didn’t want a haircut or a shave, or
hadn’t a healthy wound to dress, this was not the Empire
music hall, so I had better “hop it.”</p>

<p>It was in “hopping it” that I got astride an unseen
fiber of British communication. I went into the adjoining
ruins of a big building. A single solitary statue
stood aloof in a devastation of tumbled brick and stone.
Then, as I was stepping from one mound of rubble to
another, as one steps from rock to rock on the seashore,
I heard voices beneath me. The wreckage was so complete,
so unspeakably complete, that human voices
directly under my feet seemed at first startling and
indefinite. Moreover, to add to my confusion, I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the baa-ing of sheep, likewise under the earth. But I
could see no hole, no outlet.</p>

<p>With the average curiosity of the Britisher I searched
around till I discovered a small hole, a foot in diameter,
maybe, and a Tommy’s face framed in it laughing up
at me.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said.</p>

<p>I pulled up, bewildered, and looked at him.</p>

<p>“What in Heaven’s name are you doing in there?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“We’re telephones.... Got any matches?”</p>

<p>“I heard sheep,” I informed him.</p>

<p>“And what if you did? Got them matches?”</p>

<p>I tossed him a box. He dived into darkness, and I
heard him rejoicing with his pals because he’d found
some one who’d got a light. It meant almost as much
to them as being relieved.</p>

<p>So here was a British unit hidden where the worst
Hun shell could never find it, and, what was more, here
was the food ready to kill when, during some awkward
days, the <i>Boche</i> shells cut off supplies.</p>

<p>Then look on this picture of a war-desolated country
where nature has been stupidly scarred by Teuton
ruthlessness, and rubble-heaps are marked by boards
bearing the name of the village that had stood there:</p>

<p>The desert was never more lonely than those vast
tracts of land the armies have surged over, and this
loneliness and silence are more acute because of the
suggestions of life that have once been there. It is
impressive, awe-inspiring, this silence, like that which
follows storm.</p>

<p>Clear away to the horizon no hedge or tree appears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
all landmarks have gone, hills have been planed level
by the sheer blast of shells. Here is a rubble-heap no
higher than one’s shoulders where a church has stood,
and the graves have opened beneath pits of fire to make
new graves for the living. Patches of red powder,
washed by many rains, with a few broken bricks among
them, mark the places where houses, big and small, once
rested. To these rubble-heaps, which were once villages,
the inhabitants will come back one day, and they
will scarcely know the north from the south. Indeed,
if it were not for the fact that each rubble-heap bears
a board whereon the name of the village is written, in
order to preserve the site, they would never find their
way there at all, for the earth they knew has become a
strange country. Woods are mere patches of brown
stumps knee-high—stumps which, with nature’s life
restricted, are trying to break into leaf again at odd
spots on the trunks where leaves never grew before.
Mametz Wood and Trone Wood appear from a short
distance as mere scrabblings in the earth.</p>

<p>The ground which but a few months ago was blasted
paste and pulverization has now under the suns of
summer thrown up weed growth that is creeping over
the earth as if to hide its hurt. Wild convolvulus trails
cautiously across the remnants of riven trenches, and
levers itself up the corners of sand bags. In this tangle
the shell holes are so close that they merge into each
other.</p>

<p>The loneliness of those Somme fields! No deserts of
the world can show such unspeakable solitude.</p>

<p>One comes from the Somme to the freed villages as
one might emerge from the desert to the first outposts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of human life at a township on the desert’s rim. Still
there are no trees on the sky-line; they have all been
cut down carefully and laid at a certain angle beside the
stumps just as a platoon of soldiers might ground their
arms. For the German frightfulness is a methodical
affair, not aroused by the heat of battle, but coolly calculated
and senseless. Of military importance it has
none.</p>

<p>In these towns evacuated by the Germans life is
slowly beginning to stir again and to pick up the threads
of 1914. People who have lived there all through the
deluge seem but partially aware as yet that they are
free. And some others are returning hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Flower notes with interest the temperamental
change that has been wrought by the war in the man
from twenty to thirty-five years old. To the older ones
it all is only a “beastly uncomfortable nuisance,” and
when it is over they will go back to their usual avocations.
Here is the general view of the middle-aged men
in the battle line:</p>

<p>“What are you going to do after the war?” I asked
one.</p>

<p>I believe he thought I was joking, for he looked at
me very curiously.</p>

<p>“Do?” he echoed. “I’m going to do what any sane
man of my age would do. I’m going straight back to
it—back to work. This is just marking time in one’s
life, like having to go to a wedding on one’s busiest mail
day. I’m not going to exploit the war as a means of
getting a living, or emigrate, or do any fool thing like
that. I’m going straight back to my office, I am. I
know exactly where I turned down the page of my sales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
book when I came out—it was page seventy-nine—and
I’m going to start again on page eighty.”</p>

<p>With the younger men it is different. It has struck
a new spark in them and fired a spirit of adventure.
There are those who even enjoy the war, and to whom
one day, when peace comes, life will seem very tame.
The writer cites this case:</p>

<p>He is quite a young man, and what this adventurous
fellow was before he took his commission and went to
the war I do not pretend to know. But he displayed
most conspicuous bravery and usefulness from the hour
he fetched up at the British front.</p>

<p>One day he was very badly wounded in the back, and
as soon as he neared convalescence he became restive
and wished to return to his men, and he did return
before he should have done. The doctor knew he would
finish a deal quicker when he got back to the lines than
he would in a hospital.</p>

<p>There are some rare creatures who are built that way.
Shortly afterward he was wounded again, and while
walking to the dressing station was wounded a third
time, on this occasion very badly.</p>

<p>He stuck it at the hospital as long as he could—then
one day he disappeared. No one saw him go. He had
got out, borrowed a horse, and ridden back to his lines.</p>

<p>The absence of the fighting men from the view of
an observer of a modern battle strongly impressed the
writer, who says:</p>

<p>Most men who come upon a modern battle for the
first time would confess to finding it not what they
expected. For the old accepted idea of battle is hard
to eliminate. One has become accustomed to looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for great arrays of fighters ready for the bout, with
squadrons of cavalry waiting somewhere beyond a screen
of trees, and guns—artfully hidden guns—bellying
smoke from all points of the compass. The battle
pictures in our galleries, the lead soldiers we played
with as children and engaged in visible conflict, have
kept up the illusion.</p>

<p>You know before you come to it that it is not so in
this war, but this battle of hidden men pulls you up
with a jolt as not being quite what you expected to see.
You feel almost as if you had been robbed of something.</p>

<p>The first battle I saw on the western front I watched
for two and a half hours, and during that time (with the
exception of five men who debouched from a distant
wood like five ants scuttling out of a nest of moss, to
be promptly shot down) I did not see a man at all. The
battle might have been going on in an enormous house
and I standing on the roof trying to see it.</p>

<p>But if there is little or nothing to be seen of the human
agents that direct the devastating machines of war during
a battle, the scene of the field after the fight has
been waged discloses all the horror that has not been
visible to the eye of an observer. Mr. Flower thus
describes one section of the theater of war in France:</p>

<p>Our car rushes down a long descending road, and is
driven at breakneck speed by one of those drivers with
which the front is strewn, who are so accustomed to
danger that to dance on the edge of it all the time is
the breath of life. To slow down to a rational thirty
miles an hour is to them positive pain; to leap shell
holes at fifty or plow across a newly made road of broken
brick at the same velocity is their ecstasy. And one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the greatest miracles of the war is the cars that stand
it without giving up the unequal contest by flying into
half a hundred fragments.</p>

<p>But this road is tolerable even for a war road, and
it runs parallel with a long down which has been scrabbled
out here and there into patches of white by the
hands of men. It is Notre Dame de Lorette, no higher
than an average Sussex down, mark you, and lower than
most. Yet I was told that on this patch of down over
a hundred thousand men have died since the war began.
Running at right angles at its foot is a lower hill, no
higher than the foothill to a Derbyshire height, but
known to the world now as Vimy Ridge. And this road
leads you into a small section of France, a section of
four square miles or so, every yard of which is literally
soaked with the blood of men.</p>

<p>On the right is Souchez, and the wood of Souchez all
bare stumps and brokenness; here the sugar refinery,
which changed hands eight times, and is now no more
than a couple of shot-riddled boilers, tilted at odd angles
with some steel girders twirled like sprung wire rearing
over them; and around this conglomeration a pile of
brick powder. You wonder what there was here worth
dying for, since a rat would fight shy of the place for
want of a square inch of shelter. And where is Souchez
River? you ask, for Souchez River is now as famous
as the Amazon. Here it is, a sluggish sort of brook,
crawling in and out of broken tree-trunks that have
been blasted down athwart it, running past banks a
foot high or so, a river you could almost step across,
and which would be well-nigh too small to name in
Devonshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>We leave our cars under a bank and come on down
through the dead jetsam of the village of Ablain St.
Nazaire. The old church is still here on the left, the
only remnant of a respectable rate-paying hamlet. The
remaining portion of its square tower is clear and white,
for the stonework has been literally skinned by flying
fragments of steel, till it is about as clean as when it
was built.</p>

<p>We reach the foot of Vimy Ridge and climb up.
Here, some one told me, corn once grew, but now it is
sodden chalk, pasted and mixed as if by some giant
mixing machine with the shattered weapons of war.</p>

<p>Broken trenches—the German front line—in places
remain and extend a few yards, only to disappear into
the rubble where the tide swept over them.</p>

<p>As we climb, the earth beneath my foot suddenly gives
way, letting me down with a jerk to the hip, and opening
up a hole through which I peer and see a dead <i>Boche</i>
coiled up, his face—or so I suspect it was—resting upon
his arm to protect it from some oncoming horror.</p>

<p>We climb on up. We drop into pits and grope out of
them again, pasted with the whiteness of chalk. From
somewhere behind us a howitzer is throwing shells over
our heads, shells that come on and pass with the rush
of a train pitching itself recklessly out of control. We
listen to the clamor as it goes on—a couple of miles or
so—separating itself from the ill assortment of snarling
and smashing and breaking and grunting that rises from
the battlefield.</p>

<p>As they climbed the ridge the guns seemed to be
muffled until they got beyond the shelter of Notre Dame
de Lorette. Then, says the writer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>We suddenly appeared to tumble into a welter of
sound. And the higher we climbed Vimy, the louder
the tumult became. “Aunty,” throwing over heavy
stuff, had but a few moments before been the only
near thing in the battle. Now the contrast was such
as if we had been suddenly pushed into the middle
of the battle. The air was full of strange, harsh noises
and crackings and cries. And the earth before us was
alive with subdued flame flashes and growing bushes
of smoke.</p>

<p>Five miles away, Lens, its church spires adrift in
eddies of smoke, appeared very unconscious of it all.
Just showing on the horizon was Douai, and I wondered
what forests of death lay waiting between those
Lens churches and the Douai outlines where the ground
was sunken and mysterious under the haze.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the panorama of battle. Never a
man in sight, but the entire earth goaded by some vast
invisible force. Clots of smoke of varying colors arrived
from nowhere, died away, or were smudged out by other
clots. A big black pall hung over Givenchy like the
sounding-board over a cathedral pulpit. A little farther
on the village of Angres seemed palisaded with points
of flame. Away to the right the long, straight road
from Lens to Arras showed clear and strong without a
speck of life upon it.</p>

<p>No life anywhere, no human thing moving. And yet
one believed that under a thin crust of earth the whole
forces of Europe were struggling and throwing up
sound.</p>

<p>Among all the combatants there is a desire for peace,
says Mr. Flower, who found a striking example of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
sentiment of the <i>Boche</i> in what had been the crypt of
the Bapaume cathedral. He writes:</p>

<p>I saw scores of skulls of those who were dead many
decades before the war rolled over Europe, and on the
skull of one I saw scribbled in indelible pencil:</p>

<p>“<i>Dass der Friede kommen mag</i>”</p>

<p>(“Hurry up, Peace.”)—<i>Otto Trübner.</i></p>

<p>Now, Otto Trübner may be a very average representative
of his type. And maybe Otto Trübner’s head
now bears a passing likeness to the skull he scribbled
on in vandal fashion before he evacuated Bapaume.
But whether or no, he is, metaphorically speaking, a
straw which shows the play of the wind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>SOME STUNT—TRY IT</h3>

<p>Sergeant (drilling awkward squad)—“Company! Attention
company, lift up your left leg and hold it
straight out in front of you!”</p>

<p>One of the squad held up his right leg by mistake.
This brought his right-hand companion’s left leg and
his own right leg close together. The officer, seeing
this, exclaimed angrily:</p>

<p>“And who is that blooming galoot over there holding
up both legs?”</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>WHEN THE HUN QUIT SMOKING</h3>

<p>Tommy I—“That’s a top-hole pipe, Jerry. Where
d’ye get it?”</p>

<p>Tommy II—“One of them German Huns tried to
take me prisoner an’ I in’erited it from ’im.”</p>

<h2>WHEN “ACE” LUFBERY BAGGED NO. 13</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">LIEUT. GERVAIS RAOUL LUFBERY, an “Ace”
of the Lafayette Escadrille, has brought down his
thirteenth enemy airplane. The German machine was
first seen by Lufbery—who was scouting—several hundred
yards above him. By making a wide detour and
climbing at a sharp angle he maneuvered into a position
above the enemy plane at an altitude of five thousand
yards and directly over the trenches. The German pilot
was killed by Lufbery’s first shot and the machine
started to fall. The gunner in the German plane quickly
returned the fire, even as he was falling to his death.
One of his bullets punctured the radiator and lodged
in the carburetor of Lufbery’s plane, and he was forced
to descend.</p>

<p>To a writer in the Philadelphia <i>Public Ledger</i> Lufbery
describes the type of young man America will need
for her air fleet. He says:</p>

<p>“It will take the cream of the American youth between
the ages of eighteen and twenty-six to man
America’s thousands of airplanes, and the double cream
of youth to qualify as chasers in the Republic’s new
aerial army.</p>

<p>“Intensive and scientific training must be given this
cream of youth upon which America’s welfare in the
air must rest. Experience has shown that for best
results the fighting aviator should not be over twenty-six
years old or under eighteen. The youth under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
eighteen has shown himself to be bold, but he lacks
judgment. Men over twenty-six are too cautious.</p>

<p>“The best air fighters, especially a man handling a
‘chaser,’ must be of perfect physique. He must have
the coolest nerve and be of a temperament that longs
for a fight. He must have a sense of absolute
duty and fearlessness, the keenest sense of action and
perfect sight to gain the absolute ‘feel’ of his
machine.</p>

<p>“He must be entirely familiar with aerial acrobatics.
The latter frequently means life or death.</p>

<p>“Fighting twenty-two thousand feet in the air produces
a heavy strain on the heart. It is vital, therefore,
that this organ show not the slightest evidence of weakness.
Such weakness would decrease the aviator’s
fighting efficiency.</p>

<p>“The American boys who come over here for this
work will be subject to rapid and frequent variations
in altitude. It is a common occurrence to dive vertically
from six thousand to ten thousand feet with the
motor pulling hard.</p>

<p>“Sharpness of vision is imperative. Otherwise the
enemy may escape or the aviator himself will be surprised
or mistake a friendly machine for a hostile craft.
The differences are often merely insignificant colors
and details.</p>

<p>“America’s aviators must be men who will be absolute
masters of themselves under fire, thinking out their
attacks as their fight progresses.</p>

<p>“Experience has shown that the ‘chaser’ men should
weigh under one hundred eighty pounds. Americans
from the ranks of sport—youths who have played baseball,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
polo, football, or have shot and participated in
other sports—will probably make the best chasers.”</p>

<p>Lufbery is a daring aviator and has already been
decorated with four military medals awarded for aerial
bravery. His life has been full of adventure even
before he thought of becoming an airman. <i>The Ledger</i>
says:</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago the aviator, then seventeen years
old, left his home in Wallingford, Conn., and set out
to see the world. First he went to France, the land of
his progenitors. He visited Paris, Marseilles, Bourges,
and other cities. Then he went to Africa.</p>

<p>In Turkey he worked for some time in a restaurant.
His plan was to visit a city, get a job that would keep
him until he had seen what he desired, and then depart
to a new field of adventure. In this manner he traveled
through Europe, Africa, and South America. In 1906
he returned to his home in Connecticut. The following
year he went to New Orleans, enlisted in the United
States army, and was sent to the Philippine Islands.
Two years later, upon being mustered out, Lufbery
visited Japan and China, exploring those countries
thoroughly. Then he went to India and worked as a
ticket collector on a Bombay railroad. While engaged
at this occupation he kicked out of the railway station
one of the most prominent citizens of Bombay. The
latter had insisted that Lufbery say “sir” to him. The
aviator always did have a hot temper.</p>

<p>Lufbery’s next occupation, and the business to which
he has remained attached ever since, was had at Saigon,
Cochin China, where he met Marc Pourpe, a young
French aviator, who was giving flying exhibitions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Asia. He needed an assistant. Lufbery never had seen
an airplane, but he applied for the job and got it.</p>

<p>The two men gave exhibitions over the French provinces
in Indo-China. After one of these flights the
King of Cambodia was so pleased that he presented
each aviator with a decoration that entitled him to a
guard of honor on the streets of any town within the
realm.</p>

<p>Lufbery and Pourpe, now inseparable comrades, went
to Paris to get a new airplane. War was declared, and
Pourpe volunteered as an aviator. Lufbery, who was
anxious to be with his friend, tried also to enlist, but
was told that he must enter the Foreign Legion, as he
was not a French citizen.</p>

<p>Pourpe was shot to death during one of his wonderful
air feats; and, wishing to avenge the death of his friend,
Lufbery asked to be trained as an airplane pilot. His
request was granted and in the summer of 1916 he went
to the front as a member of the American Escadrille.
It was on August 4 of that year that he brought down
his third enemy plane, and soon afterward was decorated
with the Military Medal and the French War
Cross, with the following citation:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lufbery, Raoul</span>, sergeant with the escadrille No.
124; a model of skill, <i>sang froid</i>, and courage. Has
distinguished himself by numerous long-distance bombardments
and by the daily combats which he delivers
to enemy airplanes. On July 31 he attacked at short
range a group of four German airplanes. He shot one
of them down near our lines. On August 4, 1916, he
succeeded in bringing down a second one.”</p>

<p>Two or more combats a day in the air came to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
common occurrence with Lufbery, and many times he
returned to the base with his machine full of holes and
his clothing cut by German bullets.</p>

<p>When Lufbery heard of the death of Kiffin Rockwell
he ordered his gasoline tank refilled and soared into the
sky, in the hope of avenging the death of his comrade.
But no enemy machine was to be found. Of Lufbery’s
further exploits <i>The Ledger</i> says:</p>

<p>During the bombardment of the Mauser factories on
October 12, 1916, the intrepid aviator brought down a
three-manned <i>aviatik</i>. This was counted as his fifth
official victory and gained him additional honors. It
was during this raid that Norman Prince was mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>After the escadrille had moved to the Somme battlefield,
Lufbery, on November 9 and 10, brought down
two more German planes. These, however, fell too far
within their own lines to be placed to his official credit.
On December 27, 1916, he nearly lost his life in bringing
down his sixth flier of the enemy. Four bullets
riddled the machine close to his body. For this victory
he received the Cross of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>In March of this year he was officially credited with
bringing down his seventh German aircraft. The others
have been sent hurtling to the earth at different times
since then.</p>

<p>Lufbery is a quiet, level-headed man. His particular
friend in the Lafayette Escadrille of American fliers
is Sergeant Paul Pavelka, who also hails from Connecticut,
and who has himself seen quite a bit of the world.
Lufbery has his own special methods of attacking enemy
airplanes; he is cool, cautious, and brave, and an exceptionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fine shot. When he was a soldier in the United
States army he won and held the marksmanship medal
of his regiment. He has been cited in army orders
twice since August, 1916.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>HORSE AND HORSE</h3>

<p>An anemic elderly woman, who looked as if she might
have as much maternal affection as an incubator, sized
up a broad-shouldered cockney who was idly looking
into a window on the Strand in London, and in a rasping
voice said to him:</p>

<p>“My good man, why aren’t you in the trenches?
Aren’t you willing to do anything for your country?”</p>

<p>Turning around slowly, he looked at her a second and
replied contemptuously:</p>

<p>“Move on, you slacker! Where’s your war-baby?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>WHY TOMMY JOINED THE CHURCH</h3>

<p>“Tommy Atkins” pleaded exemption from church
parade on the ground that he was an agnostic. The
sergeant-major assumed an expression of innocent interest.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe in the Ten Commandments?” he
mildly asked the bold freethinker.</p>

<p>“Not one, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“What! Not the rule about keeping the Sabbath?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, you’re the very man I’ve been looking for
to scrub out the canteen.”</p>

<h2>LIFE AT THE FRONT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HERE are letters from the boys at the front telling
the folks at home of their experiences, humorous,
pathetic, and tragic. They present pictures of war life
with an intimate touch that brings out all the striking
detail. James E. Parshall, of Detroit, is serving with
the American ambulance unit in the French army. The
Detroit <i>Saturday Night</i>, which prints his letter, believes
that the “drive” referred to by him was either on the
Aisne front or in the Verdun sector. The letter says in
part:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear People</span>: Sherman was right! I have been
debating with myself about what to say in this letter.
I think I’ll tell you all about it and add that if by the
time this reaches you you have heard nothing to the
contrary, I am all O. K. You see, we are in a big
offensive which will be over in about ten days. As a
rule it’s not nearly as bad as this.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday we arrived at our base,
about seven miles from the lines. It is a little town
which has been pretty well shot up, and is shelled now
about once a week. In the afternoon one driver from
each car was taken up and shown the roads and posts.
The coin flopped for me.</p>

<p>The roads to the front run mostly through deep woods.
These woods are full of very heavy batteries which are
continually shelling the enemy, and, in turn, we are
continuously being sought out by the <i>Boche</i> gunners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
As a result, it’s some hot place to drive through. Also,
as a result of the continuous shelling, the roads are
very bad.</p>

<p>[Here there is a break in the letter, which begins
again after four days.]</p>

<p>I was so nervous when I started this letter that I had
to quit, and this is the first time since then that I have
felt like writing. A great deal has happened, but in
order not to mix everything up I’ll start in where I
left off.</p>

<p>Our first post from the base is in a little village which
is entirely demolished. It is in a little valley, and the
two big marine guns that are stationed there draw a
very disquieting <i>Boche</i> fire about five times a day regularly.
The next post is at a graveyard in the woods.
There are no batteries in the immediate vicinity, and
so it is quiet, but not very cheerful. (That’s where I
am now, “on reserve.”)</p>

<p>The third post out is where we got our initiation. It
was a hot one! Right next to the <i>abri</i> is a battery of
three very large mortars. Besides these there are
several batteries of smaller guns. When we came up
they were all going at full tilt. In addition, the <i>Boches</i>
had just got the range and the shells were exploding
all around us. As we jumped out of the car and ran
for the <i>abri</i> two horses tied to a tree about fifty feet
from us were hit and killed. We waited in the <i>abri</i> till
the bombardment calmed a bit. When we came out two
more horses were dead and a third kicking his last.</p>

<p>From here we walked about a half mile to the most
advanced post on that road. I’ll never forget that walk!
The noise was terrific and the shells passing overhead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
made a continuous scream. Quite frequently we would
hear the distinctive screech of an incoming shell. Then
everyone would fall flat on his stomach in the road.</p>

<p>Believe me, we were a scared bunch of boys! I was
absolutely terrified, and I don’t think I was the only
one. Well, we eventually got back to the car and to
the base.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock that night the <i>Boches</i> started shelling
the town. You can’t imagine the feeling it gives
one in the pit of one’s stomach to hear the gun go off
in the distance, then the horrible screech of the onrushing
shell, and finally the deafening explosion that shakes
the plaster down on your cot. Our chiefs were at the
outposts, and none of us knew enough to get out and go
to the <i>abri</i>, so we just lay there shivering and sweating
a cold sweat through the whole bombardment. Gosh,
but I was a scared boy!</p>

<p>Of a gas attack he writes: “We had to wear those
suffocating gas masks for five hours,” and then:</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the morning the car ahead of
us at the post started out in their masks and in the
pitch of blackness with a load. In about a half hour
one of the boys on the car staggered back into the <i>abri</i>,
half gassed, and said that they were in the ditch down
in a little valley full of gas. So we had to go down
and get their load. Believe me, it was some ticklish
and nerve-racking job to transfer three groaning
<i>couches</i> from a car in the ditch at a perilous angle to
ours, in a cloud of gas, and with the shells bursting
uncomfortably near quite frequently.</p>

<p>We finally got them in and got started. We got about
a half mile farther on to the top of the hill going down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
into what is known as “Death Valley.” In the valley
was a sight that was most discouraging. Seven or eight
horses were lying in the road, gassed, some of them
still kicking. A big <i>camion</i> was half in the ditch and
half on the road. An ammunition caisson that had tried
to get past the blockade by going down through the ditch
was stuck there.</p>

<p>Remember that all this was just at the break of dawn,
in a cloud of gas, with the French batteries making a
continuous roar and an occasional <i>Boche</i> shell making
every one flop on his stomach.</p>

<p>How we ever got through there I really couldn’t tell
you. My partner told the Frenchmen who were vainly
trying to straighten out the mess that we had a couple
of dying men in the car, so they yanked a few horses to
one side, drove the <i>camion</i> a little farther into the ditch,
and, by driving over a horse’s head and another one’s
legs, I got through.</p>

<p>On the whole, I’ve been quite lucky. Some of the
other boys have had some really awful experiences.</p>

<p>About the day after tomorrow we go <i>en repos</i>, and
it’s sure going to seem good to eat and sleep, without
getting up and sprinting for an <i>abri</i> or throwing one’s
self, and incidentally a plate of good food, on the
ground.</p>

<p>We saw a very interesting thing the other day. We
were sitting out in front of our cantonment at the base.
About a quarter of a mile from us was one of the big
observation balloons or “sausages.” Suddenly, from
behind a cloud, just above the balloon a <i>Boche</i> aeroplane
darted out. The <i>Boche</i> and the balloonist both fired
their machine guns at each other simultaneously. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
aeroplane wobbled a little and started to volplane to
earth. The balloon burst into flames. The observer
dropped about fifty feet, and then his parachute opened
and he sailed slowly down. When the <i>Boche</i> landed
they found him dead with a bullet in his chest. It was
quite an exciting sight.</p>

<p>A battle between two planes is quite common, and
one can look up at almost any time and see the aircraft
bombs bursting around some <i>Boche</i> thousands of feet
in the air.</p>

<p>At last the “drive” is over, and the letter describes
the prisoners, at whose youth he expresses surprise.
But they are happy, though nearly starved—happy to
be prisoners. The writer says:</p>

<p>I have seen hundreds of <i>Boche</i> prisoners, four thousand
having been taken in the attack. We see them
march past the <i>poste-de-secours</i> about half an hour
after they have been captured. I have talked with
several of them and received lots of interesting information.
They are all very happy, but nearly starved.
Two slightly wounded ones were brought into the post
the other day. A dirty little crust of bread was lying
on the ground. They both made a dive for it. They are
all awfully young, mostly between seventeen and twenty-one.</p>

<p>One of them told me, among other things, that by
next spring Germany would be absolutely finished. A
soldier’s fare, he said, was one pound of poor bread
and one liter of wine a day, except during a heavy
attack, when they are given some thin soup. The
civilians, he said, were still worse off, especially in the
cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>An Iowa boy, a Y. M. C. A. secretary, who is in the
<i>camion</i> service in the French army, tells how he arrived
in Paris, how he happened to become a soldier of France,
and some other interesting details, including the amount
of his salary—$1.20 per month! He found the ambulance
service—which he had intended to join—crowded,
and was told that there would be some delay in getting
cars. Even if he did get a car he was told that the
chances were against his seeing any action, as he might
be attached to an inactive division. He was therefore
urged to join the <i>camion</i> service—the ammunition truck
organization—in which he was assured he would be
kept busy day and night as long as he could stand it.
There was no camouflage about that. In order to get
into this service, one must join the French army, and
after thinking the matter over for a few days the Iowa
lad “joined” the French colors with a group of American
college boys. Here is his letter in part as printed
in <i>Wallace’s Farmer</i>, of Des Moines:</p>

<p>So here I am enrolled as a member of the French
army, carrying a French gun, gas mask, and helmet,
and eating French army rations. We are paid for our
services the sum of $1.20 a month. We underwent a
week of intensive training, being drilled in the French
manual and army movements, and spending our leisure
hours in building roads.</p>

<p>Our sector was active when we arrived at the camp,
which is situated a few miles back of the lines; so we
were put to work almost immediately. We make two
kinds of trips, day trips and night trips; and perhaps
if I tell you about my first experience in each it will
give you an idea of the character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>We were called at 3:30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, so as to be ready to
leave at four o’clock. Our convoy went to the nearby
loading station and loaded up with 468 rounds of ammunition
for the French “75” guns, which correspond to
our three-inch guns. We carted these up to the dumping
station near the batteries, and then came back. Nothing
exciting happened, and we arrived in camp about 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
That night I was on guard duty during the last watch,
and the following morning we worked our cars. The
rough roads and the heavy loads are very hard on the
cars as well as on the drivers, so that we must go over
the cars every day to keep them in the pink of condition.</p>

<p>That afternoon we got our orders to leave at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
We loaded with barbed wire, iron posts, and lumber.
The man in charge at the yards warned us that the wind
was exactly right for Fritz to send over a bit of gas.
So we hung our gas masks about our necks. It takes
only thirty seconds for the gas to get in its work on
you, and you must be prepared to put on the mask
quickly. We started for the front at dark; no lights
were allowed. We traveled along screened roads, by
columns of artillery wagons, and with infantry moving
in every direction, and with staff cars and ambulances
dodging in and out for several miles. Finally we turned
off on a narrow road which bore the marks of having
received a shelling, and went through towns which had
been leveled absolutely to the ground by shell fire, and
passed an endless chain of dugouts, until we came to
our destination.</p>

<p>Most of our cars were unloaded and drawn up on a
long, straight road just outside of the station, when our
batteries opened up on the Germans. They certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
made some noise. They had not fired many rounds
before Fritz began to retaliate, and then it was our turn
to worry. His first shells went wild over our heads,
but he got the range of the roads on which our trucks
were packed, and very soon a shell struck about half a
mile down the road. The next shell came closer. He
was getting our range and coming straight up the road
with his shrapnel.</p>

<p>By this time the remaining cars were unloaded and
had swung into line ready to leave. Just as a big
shrapnel burst about fifty yards away, our lieutenant
gave orders to start, and to start quickly. Believe me,
brother, we did! The shells were screaming over our
heads, and I was just about scared to death. I should
not have worried about the screaming shells, because
they are harmless as a barking dog. It is when they
stop screaming that you want to get worried.</p>

<p>Then he describes briefly the horrors of the war and
expresses some doubt as to man’s status being much
above that of the beast. He says:</p>

<p>When you see the fields laid waste, depopulated, battered,
and desolated, and people in the last stages of
poverty, you doubt whether man is nearer to God than
is the most cruel of beasts. It is truly a war for liberty,
for liberty in politics, ideals, and standards of living.
I believe that any one here who is at all sensitive or
responsive to his environment feels as I do.</p>

<h2>THE “FIDDLER’S TRUCE” AT ARRAS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWENTY miles away the Prussians and the Canadians
were struggling in the dust and mud for the
battered suburbs of Lens, but the trenches which were
enjoying the “Fiddler’s Truce” were not marked to be
taken by the staff officers of either army, and the only
sign of war was the growling of the big guns far away.
Here, too, Canadian opposed Prussian, but they did not
fight until the death of Henry Schulman, killed by a
most regrettable accident. He was only a private and
not sufficiently famous as a violinist to have his death
recorded in the musical journals of the world, but along
the trenches his taking off is still being discussed as
one of the real tragedies of the war.</p>

<p>Late in the fall, after the Somme offensive was over,
three Canadian regiments arrived on the Arras front
and dug themselves into the brown mud to wait until
spring made another advance practicable. Two hundred
feet away were three Prussian regiments. There was
little real fighting. When the routine of trench life
became too monotonous a company would blaze away at
the other trenches for a few minutes. At night it was
so quiet that conversation in one trench carried over to
the other, and there was a good deal of good-natured
kidding back and forth. The Canadians were especially
pleased by the nightly concerts of the Germans, and
applauded heartily the spirited fiddling of one hidden
musician. The rest of the story can best be told by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Corporal Harry Seaton, in the New York <i>Evening Mail:</i></p>

<p>“One night we held up a piece of white cloth as a
sign of truce,” he said. “With permission of our colonel
I called out and asked the <i>Boche</i> if we couldn’t have a
bit of a concert. It was agreed, and Schulman—that
was the fiddler’s name—crawled out from his trench.
One or two of our Johnnies crawled out, too, just as a
sign of good faith.</p>

<p>“Believe me, every one enjoyed the rest of that
evening, and when things grew quiet next day somebody
yelled for the fiddler to strike up a tune. He was
a cobbler in Quebec before the war, and two of our
Johnnies knew him and his wife and kids. It didn’t
take much coaxing after that, and he came out on the
strip of ‘No Man’s Land’ and played every night.</p>

<p>“On the 23d of February we were ordered on to
another part of the field and another regiment took our
old trenches. Of course, in the hurry of departure
nobody thought of Schulman.</p>

<p>“That night he brought his stool out as usual, but
before he could draw bow across the strings the strangers
filled him full of lead. Of course, they didn’t know.</p>

<p>“The chaplain told us the story next day and we took
up a collection to send back to the family in Berlin.
I wonder if they ever got it!”</p>

<h2>HARRY LAUDER DOES HIS BIT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Y. M. C. A. and Harry Lauder are two social
forces that one does not spontaneously connect up.
But the former was the agency that brought the singer
into the fighting camps of France, not only to hearten
the soldiers there, but to pay a touching tribute to the
sacrifice of his only son. Dr. George Adam, of Edinburgh,
who went with him, gives an account of the trip
in <i>Association Men</i> (New York), the official organ of
the Y. M. C. A. He also speaks of service under the
banner of the Red Triangle that Mr. Lauder has rendered
which brings the singing comedian before us in a
manner hitherto unsuspected:</p>

<p>“On a recent Sunday, although working at full pressure
during the week in the play ‘Three Cheers’ at the
Shaftesbury Theater, he gave up his rest day gladly to
go away down to two of the great Canadian camps
with me.</p>

<p>“Some one in London asked the little man why he
was going down to the camps. Why not join them in
a quiet week-end on the river? Lauder’s reply was as
quaint as usual: ‘The boys can’t get up to town to see
me, so I am off to the camps to see them.’ A right royal
time he gave them, too. Picture ten thousand men in
a dell on the rolling downs with a little platform in the
center and there Lauder singing the old favorites you
have heard so often and the soldiers love so much—‘Rocked
in the Cradle of the Deep,’ ‘Bantry Bay,’ ‘The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Laddies Who Fought and Won,’ ‘Children’s Home,’ and
many more.</p>

<p>“This was not all; his soul must have been stirred by
the sight of so many dear, brave men, for when the
meeting seemed over, Lauder began to speak to the soldiers.
And a real speech he made, full of imagery,
poetry, and fire. May I just tell you how he closed?
‘One evening in the gloaming in a northern town I was
sitting by my parlor window when I saw an old man
with a pole on his shoulder come along. He was a
lamp-lighter, and made the lamp opposite my window
dance into brightness. Interested in his work, I watched
him pass along until the gloaming gathered round and I
could see him no more. However, I knew just where
he was, for other lamps flashed into flame. Having
completed his task, he disappeared into a side street.
Those lamps burned on through the night, making it
bright and safe for those who should come behind him.
An avenue of lights through the traffic and dangers of
the city.’</p>

<p>“With passionate earnestness Lauder cried: ‘Boys,
think of that man who lit the lamp, for you are his
successors, only in a much nobler and grander way. You
are not lighting for a few hours the darkness of passing
night. You are lighting an avenue of lights that will
make it safe for the generations of all time. Therefore,
you must be earnest to do the right. Fight well and
hard against every enemy without and within, and those
of your blood who come after you will look up proudly
in that light of freedom and say, “The sire that went
before me lit a lamp in those heroic days when Britain
warred for right.” The first burst of illumination that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the world had was in the lamp lit by Jesus, or rather
he was the Light himself. He said truly, “I am the Light
of the world.” You are in his succession. Be careful
how you bear yourselves. Quit ye like men! Be
strong!’”</p>

<p>The story of the effort made to induce the singing
comedian to go “out there” touches on his well-known
human frailty, in this case triumphantly overcome:</p>

<p>“During a visit to France, and in conversation with
one in high command in the army, talk turned to the
high place Lauder had in the affections of his countrymen,
for we were both Scots. A strong desire was
expressed that he should be got out among the soldiers
in the battle line just to give them the cheer he knows
so well how to impart. I promised to endeavor to
arrange it, with trepidation, you may be sure, for you
know what is so often said of Lauder and his money.
However, with courage in both hands I asked him to
give up the week that meant many thousands of dollars
to go out to the boys.</p>

<p>“The request seemed to stagger him, and for a minute
I felt I was to fail, but it was the good fortune to receive
such a request that took his breath away. ‘Give me a
week’s notice and I go with you, and glad to go.’ I
replied, ‘I give you notice now.’ Whereupon he called
to his manager, ‘Tom, I quit in a week’; and he did,
and off to the war zone he went. My pen is unequal
to the task of describing that wonderful tour and the
amazing results of it. The men went wild with enthusiasm
and joy wherever he went. One great meeting
was apparently seen by some German airmen, who
communicated the information to one of their batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of artillery. In the middle of a song—whiz, bang!—went
a big shell very close at hand—so close, in fact,
that pieces struck but a foot or two from where we both
stood. There was a scatter and a scamper for cover,
and for three-quarters of an hour the Huns hammered
the position with two hundred big ones. When the
bombardment ended, Lauder of the big-hearted Scotch
courage must needs finish his concert.”</p>

<p>Another incident shows the heart of Harry Lauder
as those who have only heard his rollicking songs will
rejoice in.</p>

<p>“One day during our visit I was taking Harry to see
the grave of his only child, Capt. John Lauder, of the
Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, as fine a lad as
ever wore a kilt, and as good and brave a son as ever
a father loved. As we were motoring swiftly along we
turned into the town of Albert and the first sharp glance
at the cathedral showed the falling Madonna and Child.
It was a startling and arresting sight, and we got out
to have a good look. The building is crowned by a statue
of Mary holding out the child Jesus to the world; a
German shell had struck its base and it fell over, not
to the ground, however, but at an acute angle out over
the street.</p>

<p>“While we lingered, a bunch of soldiers came marching
through, dusty and tired. Lauder asked the officer
to halt his men for a rest and he would sing to them.
I could see that they were loath to believe it was the
real Lauder until he began to sing.</p>

<p>“Then the doubts vanished and they abandoned themselves
to the full enjoyment of this very unexpected
pleasure. When the singsong began the audience would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
number about two hundred; at the finish of it easily
more than two thousand soldiers cheered him on his
way.</p>

<p>“It was a strange send-off on the way that led to a
grave—the grave of a father’s fondest hopes—but so
it was. A little way up the Bapaume road the car
stopped and we clambered the embankment and away
over the shell-torn field of Courcelette. Here and there
we passed a little cross which marked the grave of some
unknown hero; all that was written was ‘A British
Soldier.’ He spoke in a low voice of the hope-hungry
hearts behind all those at home. Now we climbed a
little ridge and here a cemetery and in the first row
facing the battlefield the cross on Lauder’s boy’s resting-place.</p>

<p>“The father leaned over the grave to read what was
written there. He knelt down; indeed, he lay upon the
grave and clutched it, the while his body shook with
the grief he felt.</p>

<p>“When the storm had spent itself he rose and prayed:
‘O God, that I could have but one request. It would
be that I might embrace my laddie just this once and
thank him for what he has done for his country and
humanity.’</p>

<p>“That was all, not a word of bitterness or complaint.</p>

<p>“On the way down the hill I suggested gently that
the stress of such an hour made further song that day
impossible.</p>

<p>“But Lauder’s heart is big and British. Turning to
me with a flash in his eye he said: ‘George, I must be
brave; my boy is watching and all the other boys are
waiting. I will sing to them this afternoon though my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
heart break!’ Off we went again to another division of
Scottish troops.</p>

<p>“There, within the hour, he sang again the sweet old
songs of love and home and country, bringing all very
near and helping the men to realize the deeper what
victory for the enemy would mean. Grim and determined
men they were that went back to their dugouts
and trenches, heartened for the task of war for human
freedom by Harry Lauder. Harry’s little kilted figure
came and went from the war zone, but his influence
remains, the influence of a heroic heart.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>CAUSE FOR GRIEVANCE</h3>

<p>A wounded soldier explained his grievance to his
nurse:</p>

<p>“You see, old Smith was next to me in the trenches.
Now, the bullet that took me in the shoulder and laid
me out went into ’im and made a bit of a flesh-wound in
his arm. Of course I’m glad he wasn’t ’urt bad. But
he’s stuck to my bullet and given it his girl. Now, I
don’t think that’s fair. I’d a right to it. I’d never
give a girl ’o mine a second-’and bullet.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>DOUBLY ANNOYING</h3>

<p>A German spy caught redhanded was on his way to
be shot.</p>

<p>“I think you English are brutes,” he growled, “to
march me through this rain and slush.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the “Tommy” who was escorting him,
“what about me? I have to go back in it.”</p>

<h2>KING GEORGE UNDER FIRE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">KING GEORGE and Queen Mary have been seeing
war at close range. Together they made an eleven
days’ visit to the British troops in France, and while
there the King experienced the sensation of being under
fire. While the Queen devoted herself to the hospitals
and the sick and wounded, the King was shown all the
latest devices for killing and maiming the enemy. It
was soon after seeing what would happen to the Teutons
that he decided to drop his Teutonic name and become
Mr. Windsor. Says a dispatch from the British headquarters
in the New York <i>Sun:</i></p>

<p>On the first morning after his arrival in France, King
George visited the Messines Ridge sector of the front,
climbing the ridge while the Germans were shelling the
woods just to his left. He inspected the ground over
which the Irish troops, men from the north and the
south, fought so gallantly side by side during the taking
of the Messines Ridge, and where Major William Redmond
fell. While the King was doing this the Germans
began shelling places on the ridge which he had left but
half an hour before. The King visited also Vimy Ridge,
from which he could see the German lines about Lens,
with British shells breaking on them.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the King a special show was staged
that he might witness “that black art of frightfulness
which has steadily increased the horrors of war since
the day when the enemy let loose clouds of poisoned gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
upon the soldiers and civilians in Ypres,” says Philip
Gibbs in the Philadelphia <i>Public Ledger:</i></p>

<p>As soon as the King arrived on the field there was a
sound of rushing air, and there shot forth a blast of
red flame out of black smoke to a great distance and
with a most terrifying effect. It came from an improved
variety of flame projector. Then the King saw the projection
of burning oil, burst out in great waves of liquid
fire. A battalion of men would be charred like burned
sticks if this touched them for a second. There was
another hissing noise, and there rolled very sluggishly
over the field a thick, oily vapor, almost invisible as it
mixed with the air, and carrying instant death to any
man who should take a gulp of it. To such a thing have
all of us come in this war for civilization.</p>

<p>The most spectacular show here was the most harmless
to human life, being a new form of smoke barrage
to conceal the movement of troops on the battlefield.</p>

<p>From this laboratory of the black art the King went
to one of those fields where the machinery of war is
beautiful, rising above the ugly things of this poor earth
with light and grace, for this was an air-drome. As he
came up, three fighting planes of the fastest British
type went up in chase of an imaginary enemy. They
arose at an amazing speed and shot across the sky-line
like shadows racing from the sun. When they came back
those three boys up there seemed to go a little mad and
played tricks in the air with a kind of joyous carelessness
of death. They tumbled over and over, came
hurtling down in visible corkscrews, looped the loop
very close to the earth, flattened out after headlong
dives, and rose again like swallows. The King was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
interested in the ages of these pilots and laughed when
they confessed their youth, for one was nineteen and
another twenty.</p>

<p>The antics of the “tanks” furnished the King with
a great deal of amusement. Leaving the air-drome, he
was driven to a sunken field, very smooth and long,
between two high wooded banks. Says Mr. Gibbs:</p>

<p>Here there was a great surprise and a great sensation,
for just as the King stepped out of his car a young tree
in full foliage on the left of the field up a high bank
toppled forward slowly and then fell with a crash into
the undergrowth. Something was moving in the undergrowth,
something monstrous. It came heaving and
tearing its way through the bushes, snapping off low
branches and smashing young saplings like an elephant
on stampede. Then it came into sight on top of the bank,
a big gray beast, with a blunt snout, nosing its way
forward and all tangled in green leaves and twigs. It
was old brother tank doing his stunt before the King.</p>

<p>From the far end of a long, smooth field came two
other twin beasts of this ilk, crawling forward in a
hurry as though hungry for human blood. In front of
their track, at the other end of the field, were two breastworks
built of sand-bags covering some timbered dugouts
and protected from sudden attack by two belts of
barbed wire. The two tanks came along like hippopotamuses
on a spree, one of them waiting for the other
when he lagged a little behind. They hesitated for a
moment before the breastworks as if disliking the effort
of climbing them, then heaved themselves up, thrust out
their snouts, got their hind quarters on the move, and
waddled to the top. Under their vast weight the sand-bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
flattened out, the timber beneath slipped and
cracked, and the whole structure began to collapse, and
the twins plunged down on the other side and advanced
to attack the barbed wire.</p>

<p>Another tank now came into action from the far end
of the field, bearing the legend on its breast of “<i>Faugh-a-ballagh</i>,”
which, I am told, is Irish for “get out of the
way.” It was the Derby winner of the tanks’ fleet.
From its steel flanks guns waggled to and fro, and no
dragon of old renown looked half so menacing as this.
St. George would have had no chance against it. But
King George, whose servant it was, was not afraid, and
with the Prince of Wales he went through the steel trap-door
into the body of the beast. For some time we lost
sight of the King and Prince, but after a while they
came out laughing, having traveled around the field for
ten minutes in the queerest car on earth.</p>

<p>The great thrill of the day came later. Through the
woods of a high bank on the left came a tank, looking
rather worse for wear, as though battered in battle.</p>

<p>It came forward through the undergrowth and made
for the edge of the bank, where there was a machine
gun emplacement in a bomb-proof shelter, whose steep
bank was almost perpendicular. It seemed impossible
that any old tank should entertain a notion of taking
that jump, but this tank came steadily on until its snout
was well over the bank and steadily on again with that
extraordinary method of progression in which the whole
body of the beast moves from the nose end upward until
it seems to have a giraffe’s neck and very little else.
That very little else was sitting on the top of the
emplacement while the forward part of the tank was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
poised in space regarding the setting sun. However,
without any hesitation, the whole mass moved on, lurched
out, and nose-dived.</p>

<p>Good Lord! it was then that the thrill came. The
tank plunged down like a chunk of cliff as it fell, went
sideways and lost its balance, and, as near as anything
could be, almost turned turtle. It righted itself with
a great jerk at the nick of time just before it took the
earth below and shaved by a hair’s breadth an ammunition
dump at the bottom of the drop.</p>

<p>It was the finest tank trick I ever saw, and it was
greeted with laughter and cheers. The King, however,
and other spectators were rather worried about the lads
inside. They must have taken a mighty toss. No sound
came from the inside of the tank, and for a moment
some of us had a vision of a number of plucky fellows
laid out unconscious within those steel walls. The door
opened and we could see their feet standing straight,
which was a relief.</p>

<p>“Let them all come out,” said the King, laughing
heartily. And out they all tumbled, a row of young
fellows as merry and bright as air pilots after a good
landing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE FEMALE STANDARD OF SIZE</h3>

<p>Lady (entering bank, very businesslike)—“I wish to
get a Liberty Loan bond for my husband.”</p>

<p>Clerk—“What size, please?”</p>

<p>Lady—“Why, I don’t believe I know, exactly, but
he wears a fifteen shirt.”</p>

<h2>STORY OF OUR FIRST SHOT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“I PICKED that shell right up as it came out of
the gun—I saw it go through the air in its flight,
and I saw it strike a foot in front of that periscope!”</p>

<p>That is the way Lieut. Bruce R. Ware, Jr., U. S. N.,
who commanded the gun crew of the steamship <i>Mongolia</i>,
told of the first American shot fired in the war
at a German submarine. He related the story at a
testimonial dinner given to him and to Capt. Emery
Rice, of the <i>Mongolia</i>, upon the arrival of the steamship
at New York. The dinner was attended by many persons
prominent in business, steamship, and naval circles,
some having traveled hundreds of miles to be present.
As reported by the New York <i>Times</i>, Lieutenant Ware
told the story as follows:</p>

<p>At 5:21 the chief officer walked out on the port
bridge. The captain and myself were on our heels
looking out through the port. I saw the chief officer
turn around, and you could have seen the whole ocean
written in his face, and his mouth that wide (indicating),
and he could not get it out. He finally said: “My God,
look at that submarine!”</p>

<p>The captain gripped my arm and said: “What is
that?” I said: “It is a submarine, and he has got
up.”</p>

<p>I followed the captain out on the bridge and I looked
at my gun crews. They were all agape. The lookout
was all agape. I threw in my starboard control and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
said: “Captain, zigzag.” I did not tell him which way
to go. We had that all doped out. The captain starboarded
his helm and the ship turned to port and we
charged him (the <i>U</i>-boat) and made him go under. I
went up on top of the chart house with my phones on,
and I had a long, powerful glass, ten power. Right
underneath it I always lashed my transmitter, so that
where I was my transmitter went, and I didn’t have to
worry or hunt for it. It was always plugged in, and I
said:</p>

<p>“No. 3 gun, after gun, train on the starboard quarter,
and when you see a submarine and periscope or conning
tower, report.”</p>

<p>The gun crew reported control. “We see it—no, no—it
has gone. There it is again.” I picked it up at that
moment with my high-powered glass, and I gave them
the range—1,000 yards. Scale 50. She was about 800
yards away from us. I gave the order, “No. 3 gun, fire,
commence firing.”</p>

<p>I had my glasses on them, gentlemen, and I saw that
periscope come up. “No. 3 gun, commence firing, fire,
fire, fire.” And they did, and I picked that shell right
up as it came out of the gun—a black, six-inch explosive
shell. I saw it go through the air in its flight, and I
saw it strike the water eight inches—a foot—in front
of that periscope and it went into the conning tower.
I saw that periscope go end over end, whipping through
that water, and I saw plates go off his conning tower,
and I saw smoke all over the scene where we had hit
the enemy.</p>

<p>When Captain Rice was called upon for a speech he
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I’d much rather take the <i>Mongolia</i>
through the war zone than make a speech. All I will
say is that I am ready to go again, and I hope I have
another chance at a <i>U</i>-boat.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>HE KNEW WHAT TO DO</h3>

<p>A short time back, while a certain general was inspecting
a regiment just about to depart for new quarters,
he asked a young subaltern what would be his next
order if he was in command of a regiment passing over a
plain in a hostile country, and he found his front
blocked by artillery, a brigade of cavalry on his right
flank, and a morass on his left, while his retreat was cut
off by a large body of infantry.</p>

<p>“Halt! Order arms, ground arms, kneel down, say
your prayers!” replied the subaltern.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THAT WAS THE HYMN NUMBER</h3>

<p>Here is a story which if it is not true ought to be.
The soldier in the train was dilating on his changed
life.</p>

<p>“They took me from my home,” he said, “and put
me in barracks; they took away my clothes and put me
in khaki; they took away my name and made me ‘No.
575’; they took me to church, where I’d never been
before, and they made me listen to a sermon for forty
minutes. Then the parson said, ‘No. 575, Art thou
weary, art thou languid?’ And I got seven days’ C.B.
for giving him a civil answer.”</p>

<h2>STORIES FROM THE FRONT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">INTIMATE stories of life in the trenches “somewhere
in France” are told in two letters that describe
in man-to-man fashion incidents that present an unusual
picture of the battle front, full of color as well as of
darkening shadows. The letters were written by Mr.
Stevenson P. Lewis, serving with the American Ambulance
Corps, to his cousin, Mr. W. O. Curtiss, of Toledo,
Ohio. They are dated May 21 and 26, and extracts are
printed in the Toledo <i>Blade</i>. Mr. Lewis has no complaint
to make of the food. He finds the horse meat
“a little tough,” but seemingly palatable. He writes:</p>

<p>We get good food, but miss the extra dishes. We get
the famous army bread, rather sour taste, but am used
to it now—no butter, of course; oatmeal without milk
or sugar, horse meat, potatoes, and various flavors of
jam. The horse meat is usually a little tough, but otherwise
pretty good. Have biscuits and chocolate at the
canteen. A couple of pieces of hardtack, with water
and chocolate, do for a dinner very well when away
from camp.</p>

<p>We have considerable time just now, with nothing to
fill in, and I can’t quite go it, so I hike out for walks
and have picked up quite a few good pictures and
souvenirs. Picked up an eagle with spread wings—German
silver, a decoration worn on a German officer’s
helmet, inscribed “<i>Mitt Gott für König und Vaterland</i>.”
It is rather a rare find, as the old spiked helmet is not
worn any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Sunday we had a visit from Germany in the shape of
an airplane which dropped five bombs in the next village.
Two French machines gave chase and brought him down,
but he caused considerable excitement until he reached
the ground. They always come over at a high altitude
and do not seem in any hurry to leave, regardless of
the shrapnel shots placed around the planes. This one,
the second we have seen come down, made two complete
turns and then dived straight down.</p>

<p>We have had some trouble with some of the men in
charge, due to the wandering of one of our men into the
first line trenches. The man guilty has acted ever since
he arrived as though missing in essential brain cells, but
this time he crowned his former efforts—walked up a
valley with <i>Boche</i> trenches on one side, French on the
other, he down the middle in No Man’s Land. Lucky
he came back at all. The French called him over to their
trenches, otherwise I suppose he would be walking into
Berlin by this time.</p>

<p>We are working with an English ambulance section,
taking turns making runs to field stations, where the
wounded are sent direct from trenches. We carry them
from these first-aid posts back to another post, and the
English section, with its large cars, carry them ten or
fifteen miles farther back. Then the order is reversed.
The English are a mighty interesting lot, and most of
them have been in service since 1914, hence have seen
action all along this front. The hardest driving is at
night running up to the posts just back of the lines, for
all the moving is done then. The road is crowded with
ammunition trucks, supplies, guns, and troops, and with
no lights it is uncertain what is coming or going. Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
men have ditched their cars and run by the station, but
no serious accidents have occurred. Star shells sent up
at intervals give a blinding light and the whole country-side
is as light as day for a short time, then suddenly
dark. It is this quick change that makes it hard to
adjust our vision.</p>

<p>This English section has been through the hottest
fighting on this front, having been posted at Verdun last
year and running to the most advanced posts, but never
lost a man and had only a few slight accidents. A person
would think they were playing a safe game, but
not so, after hearing of some bombardments they ran
through. One man in the British ambulance corps has
the Victoria Cross, the hardest war medal of any to get.
He drove his car up the lines in plain sight of the
Germans. One of the stretcher bearers having been
killed, he rushed out on to No Man’s Land with another
man and rescued several men, put them into his car, and
drove off, all the time being the object of German fire.</p>

<p>The English are world-beaters in the flying game, as
I suppose you have heard. The minute a <i>Boche</i> plane
appears over their lines, a couple of fast monoplanes
are after it and usually bring it down. Heard of one
air battle between five English machines and ten Germans;
five of the German machines were brought down
and the remaining five headed for Berlin with two
English planes after them. The English did not lose
a machine. Again there were three German “sausages”
(observation balloons), and three English aviators, each
in a machine, were detailed to bring them down, each
aviator to take a balloon. Two of the Englishmen each
got their balloon, but the Germans, seeing what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
happened, lowered the third balloon. However, the
Englishman ordered to get it, being ruffled a bit because
he did not get a chance to get his “bag” as the other
two did, dived down over the balloon resting in German
territory, setting it afire and killing a number of Germans.
He was wounded badly, but succeeded in bringing
his machine back. He was awarded the Victoria
Cross. Many other war medals are given, but a man
who gets the Victoria Cross really has done a feat of
individual bravery.</p>

<h3>FUNNY THEY HADN’T MET</h3>

<p>Pretty Lady Visitor (at private hospital)—“Can I
see Lieutenant Barker, please?”</p>

<p>Matron—“We do not allow ordinary visiting. May I
ask if you’re a relative?”</p>

<p>Visitor (boldly)—“Oh, yes! I’m his sister.”</p>

<p>Matron—“Dear me! I’m very glad to meet you. I’m
his mother.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>NO END TO THE GAME</h3>

<p>Two American lads were discussing the war.</p>

<p>“It’ll be an awful long job, Sam,” said one.</p>

<p>“It will,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“You see, these Germans is takin’ thousands and
thousands of Russian prisoners, and the Russians is
takin’ thousands and thousands of German prisoners.
If it keeps on, all the Russians will be in Germany and
all the Germans in Russia. And then they’ll start all
over again, fightin’ to get back their ’omes.”</p>

<h2>UNCLE SAM, DETECTIVE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE detective work accomplished by the United
States Government since its entry into the war has
been worthy of a Sherlock Holmes, and yet few persons,
reading only the results of this remarkably developed
system, have realized that a Government heretofore
finding it unnecessary to match wits with foreign spy
bureaus has suddenly taken a high rank in this unpleasant
but absolutely essential branch of war-making—as
it has in all others. The public read of the intercepted
dispatches from the Argentine to Germany by way of
Sweden, and of the Bernstorff messages, but without a
realization of the problem that a cipher dispatch presents
to one who has not the key. And probably the
average reader is unaware that, in both the army and
navy, experts have been trained to decipher code messages,
with the result that both the making and the
reading of such dispatches have been reduced to an
almost mathematical science. The Philadelphia <i>Press</i>,
in outlining the instruction given in this important work
at the Army Service schools, says:</p>

<p>What is taught the military will furnish an idea of
the task of the code experts in the State Department,
and of the basis of the science that has unmasked the
German plans with respect to vessels to be <i>spurlos
versenkt</i> and of legislators to be influenced through the
power of German gold.</p>

<p>“It may as well be stated,” says Capt. Parker Hitt—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is, he was a captain of infantry when he said it—“that
no practicable military cipher is mathematically
indecipherable if intercepted; the most that can be
expected is to delay for a longer or shorter time the
deciphering of the message by the interceptor.”</p>

<p>The young officer is warned that one doesn’t have to
rely in these times upon capturing messengers as they
speed by horse from post to post. All radio messages
may be picked up by every operator within the zone,
and the interesting information is given that if one can
run a fine wire within one hundred feet of a buzzer line
or within thirty feet of a telegraph line, whatever tidings
may be going over these mediums may be copied by
induction.</p>

<p>In order that the student may not lose heart, it is
pointed out in the beginning that many European powers
use ciphers that vary from extreme simplicity to “a
complexity which is more apparent than real.” And as
to amateurs, who make up ciphers for some special purpose,
it’s dollars to doughnuts that their messages will
be read just as easily as though they had printed them
in box-car letters.</p>

<p>At every headquarters of an army the intelligence
department of the General Staff stands ready to play
checkers with any formidable looking document that
comes along in cipher, and there is mighty little matter
in code that stands a ghost of a chance of getting by.</p>

<p>The scientific dissection of ciphers starts with the
examination of the general system of language communication,
which, with everybody excepting friend
Chinaman, is an alphabet composed of letters that
appear in conventional order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>It was early found by the keen-eyed gentlemen who
analyzed ciphers that if one took ten thousand words
of any language and counted the letters in them the
number of times that any one letter would recur
would be found practically identical with their recurrence
in any other ten thousand words. From this
discovery the experts made frequency tables, which
show just how many times one may expect to find a
letter e or any other letter in a given number of words
or letters. These tables were made for ten thousand
letters and for two hundred letters, so that one might
get an idea how often to expect to find given letters in
both long and short messages or documents.</p>

<p>Thus we find the following result:</p>

<p>It is found that in any text the vowels A E I O U
represent 38.37 per cent; that the consonants L N<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
R S T represent 31.86 per cent, and that the consonants
J K Q X Z stand for only 1.77 per cent. One
doesn’t want to shy away from these figures as being
dry and dull, because they form part of a story as
interesting as any detective narrative that was ever
penned by a Conan Doyle.</p>

<p>For the usual purposes of figuring a cipher the first
group is given the value of 40 per cent, the second group
30 per cent, and the last 2 per cent. And then one is
introduced to the order of frequency in which letters
appear in ordinary text. It is:</p>

<p>E T O A N I R S H D L U C M P F Y W G B
V K J X Z Q.</p>

<p>Tables are then made for kinds of matter that is not
ordinary, taken from various kinds of telegraphic and
other documents, which will alter only slightly the percentage
values of the letters as shown in a table from
ordinary English.</p>

<p>Having gone along thus far, the expert figures how
many times he can expect to find two letters occurring
together. These are called digraphs, and one learns
that AH will show up once in a thousand letters, while
HA will be found twenty-six times. These double-letter
combinations form a separate table all of their own, and
the common ones are set aside, as TH, ER, ON, OR,
etc., so they can be readily guessed or mathematically
figured against any text.</p>

<p>Tables of frequency are figured out for the various
languages, particularly German, and the ciphers are
divided into two chief classes, substitution and transposition.
The writer in <i>The Press</i> says:</p>

<p>Now you will remember those percentages of vowels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and consonants. Here is where they come in. When a
message is picked up the army expert counts the times
that the vowels recur, and if they do not check with
the 40 per cent for the common vowels, with the consonant
figures tallying within 5 per cent of the key, he
knows that he is up against a substitution cipher. The
transposition kind will check to a gnat’s heel.</p>

<p>When the expert knows exactly what he is up against
he is ready to apply the figures and patiently unravel
the story. It may take him hours, and maybe days, but
sooner or later he will get it to a certainty.</p>

<p>If he has picked up a transposition fellow he proceeds
to examine it geometrically, placing the letters
so that they form all sorts of squares and rectangles
that come under the heads of simple horizontals, simple
verticals, alternate horizontals, alternate verticals, simple
diagonals, alternate diagonals, spirals reading clockwise,
and spirals reading counter-clockwise. Once one
gets the arrangement of the letters, the reading is simple.</p>

<p>For instance, ILVGIOIAEITSRNMANHMNG
comes along the wire. It doesn’t figure for a substitution
cipher and you try the transposition plan. There
are twenty-one letters in it, and the number at once
suggests seven columns of three letters each. Try it on
your piano:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="another cipher">

<td align="center">A&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

<td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;G</td>

</table></div>

<p>And reading down each column in succession you get
“I am leaving this morning.”</p>

<p>After passing over several simple ciphers as not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
“classy” enough to engage the reader’s attention, the
writer takes up one of a much more complicated nature,
which, however, did not get by Uncle Sam’s code
wizards. Follow the deciphering of this example by
Captain Hitt:</p>

<p>He began with an advertisement which appeared in
a London newspaper, which read as follows:</p>

<p>“M. B. Will deposit £27 14<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The next day this advertisement in cipher appeared:</p>

<p>“<small>M. B. CT OSB UHGI TP IPEWF H CEWIL NSTTLE FJNVX
XTYLS FWKKHI BJLSI SQ VOI BKSM XMKUL SK NVPONPN
GSW OL IEAG NPSI HYJISFZ CYY NPUXQG TPRJA VXMXI AP

CTW ROSB CSM.</small>”</p>

<p>Now just off-hand, the average man would shy away
from this combination as a bit of news that he really did
not care to read. But to the cipher fiend it was a thing
of joy, and it illustrates one of the many cases that they
are called upon to read, and the methods by which they
work.</p>

<p>As a starting-point the cipher-man assumed that the
text was in English because he got it out of an English
newspaper, but he did not stop there. He checked it
from a negative view-point by finding the letter <i>w</i> in it,
which does not occur in the Latin languages, and by
finding that the last fifteen words of the message had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
from two to four letters each, which would have been
impossible in German.</p>

<p>Then he proceeds to analyze. The message has 108
groups that are presumably words, and there are 473
letters in it. This makes an average of 4.4 letters to the
group, whereas one versed in the art normally expects
about five. There are ninety vowels of the AEIOU
group and seventy-eight letters JKQXZ. Harking
back to that first statement of percentages, it is certain
that this is a substitution cipher because the percentage
does not check with the transposition averages.</p>

<p>The canny man with the sharp pencil then looks for
recurring groups and similar groups in his message and
he finds that they are:</p>

<p>AIIWG AII BKSM BKAI CT CTWY CTW
DLMMJXL DL ESF ESBP FJNVX FJHVSI NPSI
NPUXQG OSB OSY ROSB OL OL PORTELOGJ PO
SQ SQA TP TP TLBWTPZ TLFNS TLFTWMC
UVZUA UVD UV SMKUL XMKUHW YJL YJVTI.</p>

<p>Passing along by the elimination route he refers to his
frequency tables to see how often the same letters occur,
and he finds that they are all out of proportion, and he
can proceed to hunt the key for several alphabets.</p>

<p>He factors the recurring groups like a small boy doing
a sum in arithmetic when he wants to find out how many
numbers multiplied by each other will produce a larger
one. The number of letters between recurring groups
and words is counted and dissected in this wise:</p>

<p>Now the man who is doing the studying takes a squint
at this result and he sees that the dominant factor all
through the case is the figure 5, so he is reasonably sure
that five alphabets were used, and that the key-word
had, therefore, five letters, so he writes the message in
lines of five letters each and makes a frequency table
for each one of the five columns he has formed, and he
gets the following result:</p>

<p>Now, having erected these five enigmatical columns,
Captain Hitt juggles them until he uncovers the hidden
message, thus:</p>

<p>“In the table for column 1 the letter G occurs 9
times,” he says with an air of a man having found
something that is perfectly plain. “Let us consider it
tentatively as E.</p>

<p>“Then, if the cipher alphabet runs regularly and in
the direction of the regular alphabet, C (7 times) is
equal to A, and the cipher alphabet bears a close resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to the regular frequency table. Note that TUV
(equal to RST) occurring respectively 7, 7, and 5 times
and the non-occurrence of B, L, M, R, S, Z (equal to
Z, J, K, P, Q, and X, respectively).</p>

<p>“In the next table L occurs 19 times, and taking it for
E with the alphabet running the same way, A is equal
to H. The first word of our message, CT, thus becomes
AM when deciphered with these two alphabets, and the
first two letters of the key are CH.</p>

<p>“Similarly in the third table we may take either F or
O for E, but a casual examination shows that the former
is correct and A is equal to B.</p>

<p>“In the fourth table I is clearly E and A is equal
to E.</p>

<p>“The fifth table shows that T is equal to 14 and J is
equal to 9. If we take J as equal to E then T is equal to
O, and in view of the many Es already accounted for in
the other columns this may be all right. It checks as
correct if we apply the last three alphabets to the second
word of our message, OSB, which deciphers NOW.
Using these alphabets to decipher the whole message we
find it to read:</p>

<p>“‘M. B. Am now safe on board a barge moored below
Tower Bridge, where no one will think of looking for
me. Have good friends but little money owing to action
of police. Trust, little girl, you still believe in my innocence
although things seem against me. There are reasons
why I should not be questioned. Shall try to
embark before the mast in some outward-bound vessel.
Crews will not be scrutinized as sharply as passengers.
There are those who will let you know my movements.
Fear the police may tamper with your correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
but later on, when hue and cry have died down, will let
you know all.’”</p>

<p>It all seems simple to the man who follows the idea
closely, but Captain Hitt proceeds to make further
revelations of the art. He adds:</p>

<p>“The key to this message is CHBEF, which is not
intelligible as a word, but if put into figures, indicating
that the 2d, 7th, 1st, 4th, and 5th letter beyond the
corresponding letter of the message has been used as a
key it becomes 27145, and we connect it with the personal
which appeared in the same paper the day before
reading:</p>

<p>“‘M. B. Will deposit £27 14<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> tomorrow.’”</p>

<p>This is only one of the many methods for getting
under the hide of a coded message that our bright men
of the Army and their cousins of the State and Navy
departments have worked out through years of study and
application.</p>

<h2>DIDN’T RAISE HIS BOY TO BE A
“SLACKER”</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY don’t raise their boys to be gun-shy down in
the mountains of Kentucky, so when John Calhoun
Allen, of Clay County, heard that his son had been
arrested in New York as a “slacker” he was “plumb
mad.”</p>

<p>The young man was rounded up with a bunch of other
“conscientious objectors” and taken before Judge Mayer
in the Federal Court. John C. junior told the judge
that during his boyhood in the Kentucky mountains he
had witnessed so much bloodshed that he was now opposed
to fighting and had a horror of killing a man or,
in fact, of being killed himself. The judge was puzzled.
He had never heard before of a Kentuckian with any
such complaint, so he packed the young man off to Bellevue
for the “once-over” while he communicated the facts
to his father down in Clay County, and, says the New
York <i>Times:</i></p>

<p>The answer arrived in the form of the 6 feet 2 inches
of John Allen himself. The mountaineer came into
court just before the noon hour. He wore the boots and
the corduroy trousers of the Kentucky hills. His shirt
was blue, collarless, and home-made. His coat was old-fashioned,
and in his hand he carried his big black
sombrero.</p>

<p>“May it please your honor,” said United States District
Attorney Knox, “we have with us the father of
John Calhoun Allen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The mountaineer looked the Judge squarely in the eye
and bowed. Tall and erect, he towered above every
other man in the court room and he was not in the least
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Judge,” he said, “I got your letter and I thank you
for it, and I started to answer it in writin’, but decided
that maybe it was better that I come here myself and
see what’s the matter with that boy of mine. It ain’t
like our folks to act as that youngster has acted, and I
assure you that I am plumb mad about it. I have five
boys, and this one who is in trouble here is the oldest.
Two of my lads are already in the Army and the two
youngest will be there soon as they are old enough.</p>

<p>“And so I have come all the way from Kentucky to get
this one who I hear is a backslider. All I ask is for you
to let me take my boy back to Kentucky with me, and I
will see to it that he comes to time when his country calls.
There ain’t going to be no quitters in the Allen family.
My boys that are already in the Army ain’t twenty-one
yet. This one is my oldest and he’s the first to miss the
trail, but he’ll find the trail again or I’ll know the reason
why.”</p>

<p>“I have the utmost confidence in you,” said Judge
Mayer after the old man finished, “and I shall release
your son in your custody, confident that you will see
to it that he obeys the law and registers.”</p>

<p>“He’ll register all right, Judge,” replied the old man,
“and I tell you that if he don’t, something will happen
in the public square back home, and all the folks will
have a chance to see with their own eyes that the Allens
don’t stand for no quitters at a time when the country
needs all the men it can get.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime Marshal McCarthy had sent to the
Tombs for young Allen, and the young man was waiting
in the Marshal’s office when his father arrived.
They are self-contained people down in the Kentucky
mountains. Their feelings are deep, but well controlled,
so that when father and son met there was
no show of emotion on the part of either. But the
sight of his son softened the father’s anger. He placed
his hand gently on the younger man’s shoulder, and
this is the way <i>The Times</i> describes the scene that
followed:</p>

<p>“Son,” said the father, “don’t you know what it means
to do what you tried to do? Don’t you know that you
don’t come from no such stock as these slackers and
quitters, or whatever else you call such cattle? Don’t
you know that, boy? Well, if you don’t, it’s time you
started learnin’. Now you ain’t crazy, for our folks
don’t go crazy, and you are goin’ to register, and you are
goin’ to fight, and fight your darnedest, too, if your country
calls you. Now just put that in your head and let it
stay there. I don’t want to hurt you, and I ain’t if you
do right; but I just want to say that if you don’t do
right, when I get you back home I will take you into the
public square and shoot you myself in the presence of all
the folks.”</p>

<p>The boy, with tears in his eyes, said he would register
just as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>“And I’ll fight, too, if they want me,” the boy added.</p>

<p>“Of course you will, for if you didn’t you wouldn’t be
my son,” the old man replied.</p>

<p>And that was the end of the Allen incident.</p>

<p>“That old fellow is one of the kind that makes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
country great. He is a real American,” said Judge
Mayer afterward.</p>

<p>Just before he left the Federal Building, John Allen
asked one of the deputy marshals what case was being
tried before Judge Mayer. (It was the case of Emma
Goldman and Alexander Berkman.)</p>

<p>“I noticed a man and a woman and I wondered who
they were. What did they do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“They are anarchists and they are on trial for urging
men not to register for the war,” the Marshal replied.</p>

<p>“Those are the kind’er folks who are responsible for
boys like this one of mine gettin’ in trouble,” John Allen
observed. “We don’t have folks like that down our
way.”</p>

<h2>THE 100-POUND TERROR OF THE AIR</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN he registered at a New York hotel the clerk
looked him over with a supercilious eye. He
was a trifle undersized, to be sure, and youngish—twenty-two
and weighing only one hundred pounds.
And the name, W. A. Bishop, hastily scrawled on the
register, meant nothing to the clerk—probably some
college stripling in town to give Broadway the once-over.
But a little later the same clerk looked at that name on
the hotel roster with a sensation as nearly approaching
awe as a New York hotel clerk is capable of feeling; for
he had learned that the diminutive guest was the world-famous
Maj. William Avery Bishop, of the British
Royal Flying Corps, who in three months won every
decoration Great Britain has created to pin upon the
breasts of her gallant fighters.</p>

<p>Mars is a grim god and an exacting master, but he
sometimes “smoothes his wrinkled front” at the blandishments
of the little god of Love. And it was so in the case
of Major Bishop when the gallant knight of the air
checked the war-god in the hotel coat room and slipped
away with Dan Cupid to Toronto, where his sweetheart
was waiting to welcome him. They are to be married
before he returns to the front.</p>

<p>The St. Louis <i>Post-Dispatch</i> reckons Bishop as the
greatest air fighter since Guynemer. It says of his
exploits:</p>

<p>So far as is known, Major Bishop is the only living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
man who has a right to wear not only the Military
Medal but the Order of Distinguished Service, and not
only that, but the Victoria Cross. Yet he is only twenty-two
years old, and he blushed and stammered like a
schoolboy when he tried to explain something about air
fighting at a Canadian club dinner in New York. However,
here is his record as piled up in five months at the
front:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One hundred and ten single combats with German
fliers.</p>

<p>Forty-seven Hun airplanes sent crashing to the
earth.</p>

<p>Twenty-three other planes sent down, but under
conditions which made it impossible to know certainly
that they and their pilots had been destroyed.</p>

<p>Thrilling escapes without number, including one
fall of 4,000 feet with his machine in flames.</p>

<p>The most daredevil feat of the war—an attack
single-handed on a <i>Boche</i> airdrome, in which he
destroyed three enemy machines.</p></div>

<p>These feats not only won medals for the hero, but
rapid promotion. With his appointment as Major, he
was also named chief instructor of aerial gunnery—which
is his chief hobby—and commander of an airplane
squadron.</p>

<p>Bishop went to Europe from his home in Owen Sound,
a little Ontario town, where his father is County Registrar,
in the spring of 1915 as a cavalry private. Cavalrymen
have an easy time these days waiting for the trench
warfare to end and the coming of the open fighting, when
they can get at the Hun. Bishop didn’t want to wait,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
so he was transferred to the flying corps. He made no
particular impression on these officers, but finally got a
place as observer in the spring of 1916. His machine
was shot down presently, and when he came out of
hospital he was given three months’ leave, most of which
he spent at home.</p>

<p>When he went back last fall he tried again, and this
time succeeded in qualifying as a pilot. He spent the
early winter training in England, and finally reached
the front in February. Then things began to happen.</p>

<p>His first enemy plane was brought down within a few
days, under circumstances which have not been told, but
which were enough to win the Military Medal. By
Easter his record was such that he was made flight commander
and captain. He celebrated by attacking three
German planes single-handed. Four others came to
their rescue. He got two; then out of ammunition, he
went home. This brought him the D. S. O.</p>

<p>Bishop won the Victoria Cross in a sensational air
battle. Here is the official account as given in <i>The Post-Dispatch:</i></p>

<p>“Captain Bishop flew first to an enemy airdrome.
Finding no enemy machine about, he flew to another
about three miles distant and about twelve miles within
enemy lines. Seven machines, some with their engines
running, were on the ground. He attacked these from a
height of fifty feet, killing one of the mechanics.</p>

<p>“One of the machines got off the ground, but Captain
Bishop, at a height of sixty feet, fired fifteen rounds
into it at close range. A second machine got off the
ground, into which he fired thirty rounds at 150 yards.
It fell into a tree. Two more machines rose from the airdrome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
one of which he engaged at a height of 1,000 feet,
sending it crashing to the ground. He then emptied a
whole drum of cartridges into the fourth hostile machine
and flew back to the station.</p>

<p>“Four hostile scouts were 1,000 feet above him for a
mile during his return journey, but they would not attack.
His machine gun was badly shot about by machine
gun fire from the ground.”</p>

<p>Apparently the official reporter was not interested in
the Captain’s condition. The damaged machine gun
accounts for his strategic retreat, which satisfies officialdom.
On Bishop’s behalf, it should be remembered that
an aviator lives very close to his machine gun during a
fracas—if he lives.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Bishop got the V. C. for this before-breakfast
excursion. When he was given a furlough, a few
weeks ago, it was suggested that he stop at Buckingham
Palace on his way home. There a rather small man with
a light beard and a crown pinned the three medals on the
breast of the Canadian.</p>

<p>Major Bishop himself is inclined to complain a little
at the tools with which he has to work. His faith in
incendiary bullets has been shattered, for instance.</p>

<p>“You want to bring the Hun down in flames if you
can,” he explained. “That is the nicest way. But you
can’t be sure of doing that. I shot six incendiary bullets
into one fellow’s petrol tank one day, and the thing
wouldn’t blow up.”</p>

<p>Good shooting is what does the trick, he says, and
plenty of it.</p>

<p>“Don’t trust to one bullet to kill a Hun. Get him in
the head if you can, or at least in the upper part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
body. But get him several times—one bullet is never
sure to kill one. Get hunks of them into him; into his
head. That does it. The greatest thing to teach the
new man is how to shoot.”</p>

<p>Sounds rather bloodthirsty, but this 100-pound fighter
knows his enemy and of what he is capable. While
Bishop finds bombing quite interesting, he prefers dueling,
which he says is still seeking higher altitudes; in
fact, when one is flying above 22,000 feet he is never
sure that he will not be attacked from above. The unexpected
appeals to Bishop, who cites the following as an
enjoyable occasion:</p>

<p>“I was about 10,000 feet up, going through a cloud
bank, without a thing in my mind but to get back six or
seven miles behind the Hun lines and see what was going
on, when I heard the rattle of machine guns. I looked
back and there were three Huns coming straight for me.
We all started firing at about 300 yards. I gave all I
had to one fellow and he came to within about ten yards
of me before swerving. He went by in flames. I
turned on the second and he fell, landing only about 100
yards from the first one, which shows how fast we were
going.</p>

<p>“I was excited, and the third machine escaped,” he
added apologetically.</p>

<p>An attack, two duels, and two victories while the
planes were traveling less than a quarter of a mile, at
over 100 miles an hour! Time, perhaps ten seconds.</p>

<p>It was Bishop, according to reports, who invented the
plan of diving down and shooting the Germans from behind
during an attack. He did not discuss the origin of
the idea, but denied that it did much damage. Oh, yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
an occasional machine gun nest, but, then, there are only
a few men in these. The real effect was moral. It distracts
the Hun to be shot in the back. Also it greatly
encourages the infantry who are charging.</p>

<p>“They cheer like mad,” he grinned. “They think we
are killing thousands of Huns.”</p>

<p>Traditions gather thick around such a man. Tommy
has no demigods in his religion, but he does the best he
can with his heroes. So Tommy says that Bishop
brought down nine machines in a two-hour fight one day.
But Tommy’s best story of him is given to illustrate the
nerve which enjoys being called on to fight for life on a
split second’s notice.</p>

<p>A Hun flier had used an incendiary bullet on Bishop’s
petrol tank that did work, Tommy reports. The battle
had been at a low altitude, about two miles up. Bishop’s
plane flamed up, and he fell. He was on the point of
jumping and had loosed the straps that held him into
the fuselage. Airmen dislike being burned to death.
But he decided to make a try for life at the risk of this,
and after he had fallen 4,000 feet or so took the levers
again and pulled up the nose of the plane, straightening
her out. Of course, his engine was out, so he began to
tail dive, and went a few more thousand feet that way.
Then he succeeded in straightening her out once more,
but side-slipped, and finally banked just as he struck.
One wing of his flaming machine hit first and broke the
fall. The loosened straps let him jump clear. He was
just behind the British lines, and Tommy rushed up and
gathered him in and extinguished the fire in his blazing
clothing.</p>

<p>He was not hurt.</p>

<h2>THE WATCH-DOGS OF THE TRENCHES</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE are stories a-plenty of the dash and fire of
youth in the trenches. But by no means are all the
men young who are battling on the front in France.
There are the territorials, the line defenders, the men of
the provinces, with wives and children at home.</p>

<p>“They are wonderful, these older fellows,” said an
officer enthusiastically, after a visit to the trenches.
“They ought to be decorated—every one of them!”</p>

<p>It is of these watch-dogs of the trenches that René
Bazin has written in <i>Lisez-Moi</i>, and the article, translated
by Mary L. Stevenson, is printed in the Chicago
<i>Tribune</i>. Mr. Bazin says:</p>

<p>I am proud of the young fighters, but those I am
proudest of are the older ones. These have passed the
age when the hot blood coursing through their veins
drives them to adventure; they are leaving behind wife,
children, present responsibilities, and future plans—those
things hardest to cast off. Leaving all this, as they
have done, without a moment’s hesitation, is proof
enough of their courage. And from the beginning of the
war to the present time I have never talked to a solitary
commanding officer that he has not eulogized his territorials.</p>

<p>They are essentially trench defenders, lookout men.
The young ones do the coursing. These attack, the
others guard. But how they do guard, how they hold the
ground, once won! Nearing the front, if you meet them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
on the march as they are about to be relieved, you can
recognize them even from afar by two signs: they march
without any military coquetry, even dragging their feet
a little, and they have everything with them that they
can possibly carry—sacks, blankets, cans, bagpipes,
cartridge-boxes, with the neck of a bottle sticking out
of their trousers pocket. Even when you get near enough
to see their faces many of these men do not look at you;
they are intent upon their own thoughts. They know
the hard week ahead of them. But the wind and rain
are already old friends; the mud of the trenches does not
frighten them; patience has long been their lot; they accept
death’s lottery, knowing well that they are protecting
those they have left behind, and they go at it as to a
great task whose harvest may not be reaped or even
known until months later.</p>

<p>In truth, these men from the provinces—vine-growers,
teamsters, little peasant farmers, the most numerous of
all among today’s combatants—will have played a magnificent
rôle in the Great War. History will have to proclaim
this, in justice to the French villages, and may the
Government see fit to honor and aid these silent heroes
who will have done so much to save the country.</p>

<p>They disappear quickly, lost in the defiles or swallowed
up by the mist, which night has thickened. Once
in the trenches, they find the work begun the previous
week and which has been carried on by their comrades’
hands, and when it comes their turn to guard the battlements
they hide themselves in the same holes in the clay
wall. No unnecessary movements, no flurry, no bravados,
no setting off of flashes or grenade and bomb-throwing,
by which the younger troops immediately show their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
presence in the trenches, and which only provokes a
reply from the enemy.</p>

<p>They are holding fast, but they keep still about it.
Suddenly the <i>Boches</i> are coming. There are some splendid
sharpshooters in this regiment, and in the attack of
the Seventh and in the surprise attempt of the Fourteenth
at daybreak it was seen what these men could do.
An officer said to me: “They suffer the least loss; they
excel in shelters of earthwork, they merge right into the
turf.”</p>

<p>Many of the sectors of the front are held by this
guard of older men. When the German reserves were
hurled in pursuit of the Belgian Army in 1914, threatening
the shores of Pas de Calais, a territorial division
checked the onslaught of the best troops of the German
Empire. Of their work in the trenches, Mr. Bazin
writes:</p>

<p>But do not let anyone think theirs is a life of inaction;
work is not lacking; even night is a time of reports, of
revictualing, of reconnoitering, or repairing barbed-wire
entanglements.</p>

<p>When the sector is quiet, however, the territorial enjoys
some free hours. He writes a great deal; makes
up for all the time past when he wrote almost no letters
at all and for all the time to come when he promises
himself to leave the pen hidden on the groove of the
ink-well, idle on the mantel. One of them said to me:
“They have put up a letter-box in my village. What
will it be good for after the war—a swallow’s nest?”</p>

<p>Many of these letters contain only a recital of uneventful
days and the prescribed formalities of friendship
or love, banal to the general public but dear enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to those who are waiting and who will sit around the
lamp of an evening and comment on every word. I
know young women throughout the country who receive
a letter from their husbands every day. The war has
served as a school for adults. Sometimes expediency
entirely disappears and it is the race which speaks, and
the hidden faith, and the soul which perhaps has never
thus been laid bare.</p>

<p>Here is a letter which has been brought to my notice.
For a year it had been carried in the pocket of a territorial
who wrote it as his last will and testament, and
when he was killed it was sent to his widow. Read it
and see if you would not like to have had him who wrote
it as a friend and neighbor:</p>

<p>“My dear, today, as I am writing these lines, my heart
feels very big, and if you ever read them it will be because
I died doing my duty. I ask you, before I go, to bring up
our children in honor and in memory of me, for I have
loved them very dearly, and I shall have died thinking of
them and of you. Tell them I died on the field of honor,
and that I ask them to offer the same sacrifice the day
France shall need their arms and hearts. Preserve my
certificate of good conduct, and later make them know
that their father would like to have lived for them and
for you, whom I have always held so dear. Now, I do
not want you to pass the rest of your life worshiping one
dead. On the contrary, if during your life you meet
some good, industrious young fellow capable of giving
you loyal aid in rearing our children, join your life with
his and never speak to him of me, for if he loves you it
would only cast the shadow of a dead man upon him—it
is over, my dear. I love you now and forever, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
through eternity. Good-bye! I shall await you over
there. Your adoring     <span class="smcap">Jean</span>.”</p>

<p>As showing the dogged, determined character of these
men, Mr. Bazin relates the following incident:</p>

<p>Lately, when both wind and rain were raging, an
officer told me of going up to two lookout men, immovable
at their posts in the first line trench, and joking
with them, he said:</p>

<p>“Let’s see, what do you need?”</p>

<p>“Less mud.”</p>

<p>“I am in the same boat. What else?”</p>

<p>“This and that—”</p>

<p>“You shall have it, I promise you. Tired?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Discouraged?”</p>

<p>They made a terrible face, looked at him, and together
replied: “If you have come to say such things as that,
sir, you better not have come at all. Discouraged? No,
indeed! We’re not the kind who get discouraged!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>ALL IN THE SAME COUNTRY</h3>

<p>The German officer who confiscated a map of Cripple
Creek belonging to an American traveler, and remarked
that “the German Army might get there some
time,” should be classed with the London banker who
said to a solicitous mother seeking to send cash to
San Antonio, Texas, for her wandering son: “We
haven’t any correspondent in San Antonio, but I’ll give
you a draft on New York, and he can ride in and cash
it any fine afternoon.”</p>

<h2>GENERAL BELL REDEEMS HIS PROMISE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE youngsters at Camp Upton looked with admiring
and envious eyes at the ribbons pinned on the
left breast of the man who entered headquarters. Then
they looked up at the face of the wearer of these emblems
of service in the Indian Wars, Cuba, and the
Philippines, and they saw a sturdy campaigner of field
and desert, his face bronzed by many scorching suns.
On the left sleeve of his coat were the three bars of a
sergeant with the emblem of the supply department in
the inverted V.</p>

<p>This ghost of the old Army seemed to feel a little out
of place for a moment, and then he turned to Sergeant
Dunbaugh and said:</p>

<p>“I’d like to see the General, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Have you an appointment?” asked Dunbaugh a bit
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, no, but the General told me to come back, so I
am here.”</p>

<p>As the General was then out in the camp Sergeant
Dunbaugh suggested that the old soldier tell him just
what he wanted to see him about, and, says the New
York <i>Sun:</i></p>

<p>So the story of Sergeant Busick was told—the story
of a once trim young trooper and a once dashing lieutenant
of the Seventh Cavalry, immortalized by Custer and
honored by a whole army.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago Edward Busick was assigned as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
private to G Troop of the Seventh, stationed at Fort
Apache, Arizona. At that time G was officially lacking
a captain, so a certain young lieutenant was acting commander,
and for his orderly he chose one Trooper
Busick.</p>

<p>One evening, a year later, the lieutenant received sudden
orders to report immediately to a staff post. All
that night his orderly worked with him packing his
personal belongings and helping him get ready for an
early-morning start. It was a long job, and a hard one,
but the orderly didn’t mind the work in the least; all he
cared about was the loss of his troop commander.</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose I’ll ever see you again, Busick, but if
I do, and there’s anything I can do for you, I’ll be glad
to do it,” the lieutenant told him when the job was
finished and the last box had been nailed down.</p>

<p>It wasn’t very much for a lieutenant to say to his
orderly, but it meant a great deal to this trim young
trooper. Somehow, in the old Army, orderlies get to
thinking a great deal of their officers and Busick happened
to be just that particular kind. He had an especially
good memory, too.</p>

<p>The whirligig of fate that seems to have so much to
do with Army affairs sent the lieutenant to the Philippines,
where, as colonel of the suicide regiment, he won
everlasting honor for his regiment and a Congressional
medal for valor for himself. Then on up he jumped
until his shoulder-straps bore the single star of a brigadier.
Then another star was added, and he became chief
of staff and ranking officer in the whole Army.</p>

<p>And all the while the whirligig that looks after enlisted
men saw to it that Trooper Busick added other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
colored bars to his service ribbons. And slowly he
added pounds to his slim girth and a wife and children
to his fireside. But as a heavy girth and a family aren’t
exactly synonymous with dashing cavalrymen, Sergeant
Busick saw to it that he was transferred from the roving
cavalry to the stationary Coast Artillery. And through
all the years he remembered the lieutenant and his
promise that if he ever wanted anything he would try
to get it for him.</p>

<p>One month ago Sergeant Busick got a furlough from
his Coast Artillery company at Fort McKinley, Portland,
Me., and bought a ticket to Camp Upton, New
York. There were only a few men here then, so he
didn’t have any great difficulty in seeing his old first
lieutenant.</p>

<p>For half a minute or so General Bell, commanding
officer of the Seventy-seventh Division of the National
Army and one-time first lieutenant of the Seventh Cavalry,
didn’t recognize his old orderly—but it was for
only half a minute.</p>

<p>“You’ll sleep in our quarters with us tonight,” General
Bell ordered. “Tomorrow we’ll see about that old
promise.”</p>

<p>So that night Sergeant Busick had the room between
Major-General Bell’s and Brigadier-General Read’s.
But sleeping next to generals was pretty strong for an
ordinary sergeant and he didn’t accept General Bell’s
invitation to have mess with him.</p>

<p>And a little later Busick told his old commander that
the big request that he had come across the continent to
make was that he be transferred to the Seventy-seventh
division and allowed to serve under the General. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
army tape is still long and red, so all that the General
could do was to send the sergeant back to his post and
promise that he would do all that he could. This, it
proved, was sufficient.</p>

<p>For Sergeant Edward Busick, smiling and happy
with his reassignment papers safely tucked away in the
pocket of his blouse under his half a foot of service
ribbons, came back to report for duty. It took twenty
years to do—but he’s done it.</p>

<p>And the National Army of Freedom hasn’t any idea
as yet how much richer in real soldier talent and color
it is today. But a certain old campaigner, who used to
be a first lieutenant of cavalry, knows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>NO GREAT LOSS</h3>

<p>An American stopping at a London hotel rang several
times for attendance, but no one answered. He
started for the office in an angry mood, which was not
improved when he found that the “lift” was not running.
Descending two flights of stairs, he met one of
the chambermaids.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with this dashed hotel?” he
growled. “No one to answer your call and no elevator
running.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, sir,” said the maid, “the Zeps were
reported and we were all ordered to the cellar for
safety.”</p>

<p>“——!” ejaculated the American. “I was on the
fifth floor and I wasn’t warned.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the bland reply, “but you see, sir,
you don’t come under the Employers’ Liability Act, sir.”</p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM THE FRONT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“LAST evening we went out into a field, and read
Jane Austen’s ‘Emma’ out loud.”</p>

<p>Do you get the picture? Can you see the fading
glory of the sunset sky, and hear the soft breeze, sweetly
laden with the scent of new-mown hay, as it murmurs
through the gently rustling leaves—a real autumn scene
of rural peace and quiet?</p>

<p>Yes? Well, you are quite mistaken. That is an
extract from a letter written by an ambulance driver on
the French front. And so you see that war is not all
horror.</p>

<p>Emerson Low, the son of Alfred M. Low, of Detroit,
went to France with a group of college boys. He joined
the American Field Ambulance Service, and is now in the
thick of the fighting in the Champagne district. The
Detroit <i>Free Press</i> prints some extracts from his letters
to his family. In one he tells of his trip to the posts:</p>

<p>Day before yesterday several of us started out for the
posts. I carried the <i>médecin divisionnaire</i> and went a
little before the others. In spite of the fact that the
fields are being recultivated and the searness of former
battles is somewhat concealed, the road to the front is
rather a grim affair, and you are startled when you pass
through a town deserted and demolished. There is
quite a large town between this one and the front. It is
uninhabited except for a few soldiers and a yellow dog
that slinks about in the doorways.</p>

<p>I left the <i>médecin divisionnaire</i> at his <i>abri</i>, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
further along the road, a road hidden completely by
strips of burlap tied to poles. The first post is in a
little wood. There were two of us there, and we tossed
a coin to see who would take the first call. I won and
waited for an ambulance to come in from one of our three
posts. These posts are along the front of the hill where
the battle is taking place. They are all reached by
going through and then beyond X (you remember the
little destroyed town with the church which I spoke of
during our first month). The first post was a smaller
town than X, and is now razed completely to the ground.
The second is about one-fourth of a mile to the right and
the third—which can only be reached during the night
and left before dawn—is a German <i>abri</i>, formerly a dugout
of German officers. The German <i>saucises</i> are
directly above the road, and any machine would be
shelled in the daytime. The posts are close together and
are reached by exposed roads.</p>

<p>My call came about noon. I was given an orderly,
and left for the first post. From the road we could see
the shells breaking on the hill and in the fields about,
where the French batteries were hidden. We reached
the post, backed the machine into a wide trench, which
hid it from view, and then went into the dugout. It was
a new iron dugout, about 30 feet long and 10 or 12 feet
broad, with bunks on either side. On top were heaped
bags of sand and dirt.</p>

<p>We read until about two o’clock, when several shells
fell in the battery field a few meters behind us. Then a
few shells fell in a field to the right, and in another
moment we were in the midst of a bombardment. It
lasted all afternoon. Two men trying to enter the dugout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
were hit, one in the throat and the other in the
shoulder, but not badly. About six o’clock it grew so
bad and so many shells fell on the roof of the dugout
that we had to leave, cross through some trenches—a
strange-looking procession, crouching and running along—and
get into a deep cave about twenty feet under the
ground, where we stayed until eight o’clock in the evening.
Then the firing became intermittent, the shells hit
further to the right and left, and we ran back into the
dugout.</p>

<p>It was still light and an airplane soared above us, the
noise of which is to me, for an unaccountable reason, one
of the most reassuring sounds I have ever heard.</p>

<p>Quite jocularly he writes of supper, first having
looked at his car which he found uninjured, although
covered with dirt from exploding shells. Continuing, he
says:</p>

<p>There were about eight of us, the orderly and myself,
the lieutenant-doctor in charge, and three or four old
<i>brancardiers</i>, who, when they ate their soup made more
noise than the shells. After every few spoonfuls, to
avoid waste, they poked their mustaches in their mouths
and sucked them loudly.</p>

<p>During the evening the firing became steady on both
sides, the French battery pouring their shells, which
whistled over our dugout. We went to bed, secure in
this iron cylinder, whose great ribs stood like the fleshless
carcass of a beast, which to destroy would be a
worthless task. A stump of a candle lay wrapped in
our blankets in the bunks. It was rather comfortable,
except that my bed was crossed at the top by a piece of
iron just where my head lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>All through the night there was a continuous commotion
in the dugout, the <i>brancardiers</i> running around and
talking in loud voices about things we were too sleepy
to understand. We had no <i>blessés</i> during the night (an
exceptional thing—this morning they had fifty from one
post) and were relieved about half-past ten the next
morning. I returned to the large town, where our cantonment
had been changed to another quarter of the
village.</p>

<p>This is an exceptionally fine cantonment and was recently
occupied by the British Ambulance, whose place
we have taken. I think it was originally an officers’
barracks. Two low cement buildings, faced with red
brick and roofed with red tile, stand on one side, and
opposite these are the stables, used by the “Genies.”
In front of the houses are some trees and grass. Each
house (one story in height) is divided into four parts,
accessible by four doors.</p>

<p>Jim, Rogers, and I have one room to ourselves off the
third hallway and in front. There are three other rooms
accessible by the same hallway. It is almost like a
separate house, as each division has its flight of steps
before the door and there is a main sidewalk running
under all the front windows. We have our three
stretchers on the floor, two cupboards, a broken mirror,
and two camp-stools. We keep our trunks, etc., right in
the room and it saves transferring them every trip to the
posts. There is a large French window with blue shutters.
We certainly are comfortably located. There are
no showers after all (we had expected two), except one
that is broken, and we wash from our <i>bidons</i> (canteens)
with a sponge, which is almost as good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim and Rogers came back yesterday shortly before I
did. They had both been to the same post, the second
one, and been caught in a gas-attack which lasted for an
hour. They sat in the <i>abri</i> with their masks on (the
masks are a greenish color, with two big round windows
for the eyes) and, of course, with the helmets, the <i>abri</i>
was crowded, and from their description they must have
looked like so many big beetles crouching together.
There is absolutely no danger with the masks, however,
and we carry one always with us (even in town) and
one fastened in the car.</p>

<p>Last evening we went out into a field and read Jane
Austen’s “Emma” out loud. Jim and Rog left this
morning for the posts and I go tomorrow.</p>

<p>Of the routine work of the ambulance driver he
writes:</p>

<p>On account of the night driving we have lately put
two men on each car, a driver and an orderly who just
goes back and forth between the posts. Five cars are
out every day and eight drivers. Three cars begin at
the posts and two wait in the woods. As a car comes in
from a post, another is sent out from the woods and
this driver takes with him the orderly who has just
come in, as only one man is necessary to make the trip
from the woods to the hospital. From the hospital the
latter returns to the woods, and thus a relay is formed.
The day before yesterday I was at post 1; yesterday
(beginning at noon), I was <i>en repos</i> for the day; today
I am <i>en remplacement</i>, that is practically the same as
repose, but if any extra cars are wanted in case of an
attack, etc., we have to be within call. I am fourth in
the list and don’t expect to go out. Tomorrow I go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
my own car, next day repose, next day as orderly to post
3, next day repose, etc. The work is as interesting as
ever.</p>

<p>In another letter which <i>The Free Press</i> prints Mr.
Low tells of a battle between airplanes directly over his
head. The engagement ended with the winging of both
machines. The letter reads:</p>

<p>The German machine fell between the lines, the
French plane near one of our posts. There was a terrific
fight, which we could hardly see, as it was very high in
the air. The French plane caught on fire and began
to fall. After some meters it was entirely enveloped in
smoke and the three aviators had to jump, which was a
quicker death. When they were found, parts of their
bodies had been burned away.</p>

<p>Just before this the first German shell fell in our
cantonment. It was about half-past seven in the morning
and we were all asleep when we heard the rush and
explosion of an <i>obus</i>. It struck about two meters from
the barracks and made a large hole in the road. Three
shells usually fall in one place, but no other followed.</p>

<p>For a day of repose it certainly was disturbing.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had a hot shower at the hospital near
here. It certainly seemed good, after bathing for two
months out of a small reserve water can.</p>

<p>This morning we are at the second post. Before the
war there were really enough houses to call it a small
town, but it has been so completely destroyed that only
stumps of the buildings remain. Batteries have been
planted all about it, and at present they are receiving a
heavy shelling from the Germans.</p>

<p>Mr. Low seems to possess an excellent nervous organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and a dependable imagination which he finds
quite useful. He says:</p>

<p>We are kept in the dugout, which, provided with
chairs and a table, is very comfortable. It is rather
pleasant to be securely seated here with books and
listening to the “rush” of the shells overhead. It is like
being before a grate fire and listening to a winter’s storm
outside. As long as no <i>blessés</i> are brought in we can
sit here and warm our feet until the storm is over. Our
beds are all made on the stretchers (placed high enough
to keep out the rats), and we intend to spend a pleasant
afternoon reading. I have Rog’s Shakespeare, and I am
reading “Cymbeline.”</p>

<p>We have just had lunch—hot meat, lentils, camembert,
and the inevitable Pinard. The bombardment has
nearly died away, so we can sit out a while and enjoy
a very delightful August day. This post is reached by
an old Roman road, which is rather badly torn up.
They have just put up a screen of burlap to conceal it
from the <i>saucisses;</i> that is, to hide the traffic on it, for
the German gunners know where every road lies.</p>

<p>(Later) A young fellow of about nineteen was just
carried in. He was at the battery post a few meters
behind us and became half-crazed by the shells during
the bombardment. It is quite a common occurrence,
especially with the men in the trenches. The French
call it <i>commotion</i>, and the mind becomes so stunned that
often they lose their speech or become totally stupid.
The lieutenant said that this was a bad case and that
if another shell fell near the man he would go mad. He
asked us to take the fellow back to the hospital as soon as
possible, and I had to ride in the back of the ambulance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with him all the way to keep him quiet. Fortunately no
shells came near the car.</p>

<p>After supper we sat near the edge of the road and
watched two or three battalions pass by on their way
to the trenches. The road filled with carts and supply
wagons as soon as the <i>saucisses</i> descended. These
vehicles travel between towns in the rear to a communication
trench a little beyond our post, a point which is a
terminus for all traffic. From there the ammunition and
supplies are carried to the trenches by hand.</p>

<p>There is a little railroad running from that point,
beyond our post; horses pulling small flat cars loaded
with wood, barbed wire, etc., for the trenches. A young
<i>poilu</i>, standing up and waving his arms, came spinning
down the hill in an empty car. He nearly caused a
collision and I never saw a man so yelled and screamed
at as this one was by his sergeant. The officer scolded
him for a quarter of an hour and shouted himself hoarse:
“<i>Quelle bêtise!</i>”</p>

<p>About nine we went down into the <i>abri</i>, lighted a
candle on the table, and read until about ten, when a man
burst through the door, shouting:</p>

<p>“<i>Gaz! Gaz! M. Médecin!</i>” and dashed out again.
The <i>médecin</i> went outside, and, returning, told us to
have our masks ready, that gas was coming over the hill
and blowing in our direction. We waited about ten
minutes and heard the alarm bell ring—a signal to warn
that a gas attack is near. We sat waiting with our
masks at our elbows, but the wind carried the gas in
another direction and we did not have to use them.</p>

<p>These attacks are frequent, but not dangerous; as at
every hour of the day a man stands in the first line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
trench (with a bell at his side) to give warning of gas.
The masks that we always carry at our belts are positive
guards against any sort of gas.</p>

<p>We read until twelve and then went to bed, lucky in
having only one trip through the day.</p>

<h3>HELPING HIS WIFE OUT</h3>

<p>An officer was surprised one day when searching the
letters of his detachment to read in one of them a passage
that was something like this:</p>

<p>“We have just got out of shell-fire for the first time
for two months. It has been a hard time. The Germans
were determined to take our field bakery, but, by
gee! we would not let them. We killed them in thousands.”</p>

<p>This was a letter from one of the bakers to his wife.
None of the detachment had been a mile from the
base, and they had never seen a German, except as a
prisoner. My friend knew the writer well, and could
not help (although it was none of his business) asking
him why he told such terrible lies to his poor wife. The
soldier said:</p>

<p>“It’s quite true what you say, but it’s like this, sir.
When my wife and the wives of the other men in the
place where I live are talking it all over in the morning
I couldn’t think to let her have nothing to say and the
others all bragging about what their men had done with
the Germans. That’s the way of it, sir.”</p>

<h2>MEET TOMMY, D. C. MEDAL MAN</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IF war is not a great leveler—and we have been told
numberless times that it is—it is certainly the Great
American Mixer, and Camp Upton, L. I., is probably the
best example extant thereof, so to speak. The Bowery
boy and the millionaire rub elbows—you have probably
heard that before, but it is nevertheless true—and the
owners of Long Island show places sleep in cots next
to their former gardeners. But probably the most interesting
character at Camp Upton is the barber who was
at one time a sergeant in the British Flying Corps, and
wears the King’s Distinguished Conduct Medal—that
is, he probably would wear it if he hadn’t left it at
“’ome in a box.” The New York <i>Sun</i> says:</p>

<p>Down on the muster pay roll the D. C. medal man is
Harry Booton, but over in the 304th Field Artillery’s
headquarters company barracks they call him Ben
Welch, the Jewish comedian. But for all that his real
name is <i>Ortheris</i>, who even Kipling himself thought had
lain dead these twenty years and more in the hill country
of India. And for the brand of service for his reincarnation
he has chosen the artillery—the bloomin’, bloody
artillery that he used to hate so much when he and <i>Mulvaney</i>
were wearing the infantry uniform of the little old
Widow of Windsor.</p>

<p>London cockney he was then, a quarter of a century
ago, and London cockney he is today. And if there be
some who say his name is not really <i>Ortheris</i>, let it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
stated that names are of small moment after all. It’s
the heart that counts—and the heart of this under-sized
little Jewish cockney is the heart of Kipling’s hero—and
the soul is his and the tale is his. And instead of telling
his yarn to <i>Mulvaney</i> he now tells it to an Italian barber
they call Eddie rather than his own gentle name of
Gasualdi.</p>

<p>From Headquarters Hill, where the Old Man With the
Two Stars looks out and down on his great melting-pot
that’s cooking up this stirring army of freedom, you
walk a half mile or so west until you stumble on Rookie
Roose J 18, where the headquarters company and the
band of the 304th Field Artillery play and sing and
sleep and work. In one corner of the low, black-walled
washroom nestling next the big pine barracks, Eddie
the Barber lathers, shaves, and clips hair for I. O. U.’s
when he isn’t busy soldiering. And into Eddie’s ears
come stories of girls back home and yarns of mighty
drinking bouts of other days, and even tales of strange
lands and wars and cabbages and kings. Eddie is the
confidant of headquarters company.</p>

<p>If you stand around on one foot and then another long
enough, and add a bit now and then to the gaiety of the
nations represented in Eddie’s home concocted tonsorial
parlor you’ll hear some of these wild yarns pass uninterrupted
from the right to the left ear of Eddie. And if
you’re lucky you may even hear the tale of the D. C.
medal—and the five wounds, and the torpedoed bark,
and the time the King’s hand was kissed, and all from
the lips of <i>Ortheris</i>, alias Harry C. Booton, alias Ben
Welch.</p>

<p>And so, if you will kindly make way for the hero,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
whose medal is “at ’ome in me box,”—but who did not
forget to bring his cockney accent along, to which he has
added a dash of the Bowery—you may listen to the tale
that was told to the <i>Sun</i> man:</p>

<p>“I was boined down in Whitechapel, Lunnon, and me
ole man died seventeen years ago in the Boer War,” the
tongue of Harry began his tale: “’E was a soger under
‘Mackey’ McKenzie, and ’e was kilt over in Sout Africey.
Well, when Hingland goes into this war I says to meself
I’ll join out to an’ do me bit, an’ so I done wit’ the Lunnon
Fusileers, and after two or three months trainin’ we
was sint to Anthwerp, but we didn’t stop there very long.</p>

<p>“Then we fights in the battle of Mons and Lille—I
don’t know how you spells that Lille, but I think it’s
‘L-i-l’—or somethin’ loik that. Well, in the battle of
Mons I gets blowed up. Funny about that. You see, a
Jack Johnson comes along and buries me, all except me
bloomin’ feet, and then I gets plugged through both legs
with a rifle bullet and I’m in the hospital for a month.
When I gets out I’m transferred to the Royal Flying
Corps and I goes to the Hendon or sumthin’ loike that
aereodrome up Mill Hill way, fur trainin’. You see, I
was a stige electrician in the Yiddish teaters on the Edgware
road, and knowin’ things like that I was mide a
helper and learnt all about flying machines.”</p>

<p>The b-r-r-r-r-r of an airplane—the first one to fly over
the camp—caused Henry’s ear to cock for a second and
then a smile to pop out of his face.</p>

<p>“’Ere’s one of the bloomin’ things now,” he went on.
“Well, I was made a sergeant an’ arfter a bad bomin’ of
Lunnon by the Fritzes six of us machines was sent to
pay compliments to the Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was dark and cold and nasty when we started out
to attack Frederickshaven and give ’em some of their
own medicine.</p>

<p>“Three hundred miles we flies an’ I’d dropped eighteen
of my nineteen bums—you see I was riding with
Sergeant-Major Flemming—when they opens up on us
with their antiguns and five of us flops down, blazin’
and tumblin’. Then somethin’ hits me back and somethin’
else stings me arm and then I felt her wabble and
flop. I glances behind and my sergeant is half fallin’
out and just as he tumbled I mikes a grab for ’im. ’E
was right behint me and so as to right the machine I
grips him with me teeth in his leather breetches and
then I throws ’im back and swings into his seat and
tramps on the pedal for rising. Up we goes to 9,000
feet, but it was too bloomin’ cold up there, so I come
down some and points back for Hingland.</p>

<p>“The sergeant ’e were there with me, and I was glad
efen if ’e had been kilt dead. You wouldn’t want ’im
back there with them <i>Booches</i>—’im my pal and my
sergeant. I wasn’t going to let the <i>Booches</i> have ’im.</p>

<p>“More’n 300 miles I had to fly—6 degrees it were—when
I caught Queensborough, and then I come down.
Funny about that—just as soon as I ’it the ground I
fainted loike a bloomin’ lidy.</p>

<p>“An’ I was up in a Hinglish ’ospital in Lunnon when
I come to a couple of d’ys after. An’ I wykes a bloomin’
’ero, and the King ’e sends for me an’ some other ’eroes,
and we all goes to Buckingham Palace, and ’is Majesty
the King and Queen Mary and a ole bloomin’ mess of
them bloomin’ dooks and lydies comes and the King pins
the medal on me. Me a ’ero with a D. C. medal. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
now I’m warin’ this bloomin’ kiki-ki and hopin’ to get
another crack at Kaiser Bill and Fritz the sauerkraut.”</p>

<p>The ’ero was finally invalided out of service and
ordered to the munitions factories in northern England.
Having no inclination for this work, he stowed away on
the Swedish bark <i>Arendale</i>, which was torpedoed when
fifteen days out from London. He was picked up by the
Dutch steamship <i>Leander</i> and finally landed in New
Orleans. The <i>Sun</i> continues:</p>

<p>Then Harry came to New York a little over a year
ago and made his abode at 157 Rivington street. By
day he worked in a A-Z Motion Picture Supply Company,
72 Hester street, and by night he told brave tales
of war and sang snatches of opera that he had learned
behind the scenes in London.</p>

<p>Then came America’s entrance into the Great War
and the selective service examination. At Board 109
Harry demanded that although he was a British subject
he be allowed to go. And after considerable scratching
of heads the members of Board 109 decided to ship
Harry to Camp Upton with the first increment on September
10, and what was more, to make him the squad
leader on the trip.</p>

<p>“Salute me, ya bloomin’ woodchopper,” Harry, ex-Tommy
Atkins, shouted in derision at some lowly private
who ventured to try a light remark. “Hain’t I
yer superior? Hain’t I actin’ corporal? Hain’t I goin’
to be a sergeant-major? Awsk me—hain’t I?”</p>

<p>And the answer was decidedly and emphatically yes.
And power to ye, Harry Booton—medal or no medal.</p>

<h2>GERMAN FALCON KILLED IN AIR-DUEL</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE old days when armies ceased fighting to watch
their two champions in single combat have come
back again. It was on the Western front, and the engagement
that resulted in the death of Immelman the
Falcon, Germany’s most distinguished Ace, was in very
truth a duel—no chance meeting of men determined to
slay one another, but a formally arranged encounter,
following a regular challenge, and fought by prearrangement
and without interference. The battle was
witnessed with breathless interest by the men of both
armies crouched in the trenches, separated by only a
few feet of No Man’s Land, while the fire of the anti-aircraft
guns on both sides was stilled.</p>

<p>The victor in the spectacular fight was Captain Ball,
the youthful English pilot who has only two notches less
on the frame of his fighting machine than had the Falcon,
who was credited with fifty-one “downs.” The story of
the duel, which was declared to have been one of the
most sensational events of the war, is told in a letter
written by Col. William Macklin, of the Canadian
troops, to a friend in Newark, N. J. Colonel Macklin,
who was one of the eye-witnesses of the fight, writes in
his letter, which is printed in the New York <i>Tribune:</i></p>

<p>One morning Captain Ball, who was behind our sector,
heard that Immelman the Falcon was opposite.</p>

<p>“This is the chance I’ve been waiting for; I’m going
to get him,” declared Ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Friends tried to dissuade him, saying the story of
Immelman’s presence probably was untrue. Ball would
not listen.</p>

<p>Getting into his machine, he flew over the German
lines and dropped a note which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Captain Immelman: I challenge you to a man-to-man
fight, to take place this afternoon at two o’clock.
I will meet you over the German lines. Have your anti-aircraft
guns withhold their fire while we decide which
is the better man. The British guns will be silent.</p>

<p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Ball.</span>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>About an hour afterward, a German aviator swung out
across our lines. Immelman’s answer came. Translated
it read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Captain Ball: Your challenge is accepted. The
German guns will not interfere. I will meet you promptly
at two.</p>

<p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Immelman.</span>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>Just a few minutes before two o’clock the guns on
both sides ceased firing. It was as though the commanding
officers had ordered a truce. Long rows of heads
popped up and all eyes watched Ball from behind the
British lines shoot off and into the air. A minute or two
later Immelman’s machine was seen across No Man’s
Land.</p>

<p>The letter describes the tail of the German machine
as painted red “to represent the British and French
blood it had spilled,” while Ball’s had a streak of black
paint to represent the mourning for his victims. The
machines ascended in a wide circle, and then:</p>

<p>From our trenches there were wild cheers for Ball.
The Germans yelled just as vigorously for Immelman.</p>

<p>The cheers from the trenches continued. The Germans’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
increased in volume; ours changed into cries of
alarm.</p>

<p>Ball, thousands of feet above us and only a speck in
the sky, was doing the craziest things imaginable. He
was below Immelman and was, apparently, making no
effort to get above him, thus gaining the advantage of
position. Rather he was swinging around, this way and
that, attempting, it seemed, to postpone the inevitable.</p>

<p>We saw the German’s machine dip over preparatory
to starting the nose dive.</p>

<p>“He’s gone now,” sobbed a young soldier at my side,
for he knew Immelman’s gun would start its raking fire
once it was being driven straight down.</p>

<p>Then, in the fraction of a second, the tables were
turned. Before Immelman’s plane could get into firing
position, Ball drove his machine into a loop, getting
above his adversary and cutting loose with his gun and
smashing Immelman by a hail of bullets as he swept by.</p>

<p>Immelman’s airplane burst into flames and dropped.
Ball, from above, followed for a few hundred feet and
then straightened out and raced for home. He settled
down, rose again, hurried back, and released a huge
wreath of flowers almost directly over the spot where
Immelman’s charred body was being lifted from a
tangled mass of metal.</p>

<p>Four days later Ball, too, was killed. He attacked
single-handed four Germans. He had shot one down
and was pursuing the other three when two machines
dropped from behind the clouds and closed in on him.
He was pocketed and was killed—but not until he had
shot down two more of the enemy.</p>

<h2>HE TAUGHT THE “TANK” TO PROWL
AND SLAY</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ALONG with many other things with finer names, for
which credit is due him, Col. E. D. Swinton, of the
British Royal Engineers, will go down in history as the
father of the tank, that modern war monster and engine
of destruction which made its professional début on the
Somme battlefield and which did such effective work in
French and British drives.</p>

<p>Colonel Swinton is a pleasant, mild-mannered gentleman,
the last person in the world one would expect to
bear any relationship to the tank. In fact, the virtue of
modesty in him is so well developed that he refuses to
accept all the glory, and insists upon sharing the
parental honors with an American, Benjamin Holt, inventor
of the tractor.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that the Holt tractor is the tank by
any means,” he says, “but without the Holt tractor there
very probably would not have been any tank.”</p>

<p>Arthur D. Howden Smith, writing in the New York
<i>Evening Post</i>, declares:</p>

<p>It is practically impossible to get Colonel Swinton to
admit outright that he is the parent of the tank; yet
father it he did, and he was also the first captain of the
tanks in the British Army; he organized the tank unit in
France, and he launched the loathly brood of his offspring
in their initial victory on the Somme battlefield.
If any man knows the tank, he does, for he created it and
tamed it and taught it how to prowl and slay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Swinton began to think about tanks several
years before Austria sent her ultimatum to Servia, but
he is scrupulously careful to say that many men were
thinking more or less vaguely along the same lines at
the same time. Indeed, the proposal of the tank as an
engine for neutralizing the effect of machine gun fire
was actually made by two sets of men, one to the War
Office and one to the Admiralty, and neither group was
aware that the other was working along the same lines.
Still, we may believe unprejudiced testimony which gives
to Colonel Swinton the principal credit for convincing
the higher authorities in London that mobile land-forts
were practicable.</p>

<p>“In July, 1914, I heard that Mr. Benjamin Holt, of
Peoria, Ill., had invented a tractor which possessed the
ability to make its way across rugged and uneven
ground,” he stated. “But several years before that a
plan for a military engine practically identical with the
tank had been sketched upon paper, when a tractor of
another make was tried out in England. That first plan
came to nothing. We weren’t ready for it then.</p>

<p>“The reports of the Holt tractor served to stimulate
my interest in the idea all over again, and when I went
to France with Lord French in August, 1914, and saw
what modern warfare was like, I became convinced that
an armored car, capable of being independent of roads
and of traversing any terrane to attack fortified positions,
was a necessity for the offensive.”</p>

<p>The Colonel, with a quizzical smile, here called attention
to the fact that the principal German weapon of
slaughter was the invention of an American—Hiram
Maxim—and he thought it quite fitting that the weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to combat it should be credited, at least in part, to the
American inventor of the tractor. Continuing, he said:</p>

<p>“By October, 1914, I had a fair conception of the kind
of engine which might be relied upon to neutralize the
growing German power in machine guns, combined with
the most elaborate fortifications ever built on a grand
scale. You see, their fire ascendency in the meantime
had enabled them to dig in with their usual thoroughness.
In October I returned to England to try to interest the
authorities at the War Office in my idea. I had my
troubles, but I did not have as many troubles as I might
have had, because other men of their own accord were
working along the same lines.</p>

<p>“You must get this very straight, mind. Whatever
credit there may be for inventing the tanks belongs not
to any one man, but to many men—exactly how many
nobody knows. It is even rather unfair to mention any
names, my own as well as those of others. For, besides
those men who actually worked to perfect the tanks,
there were others who had conceived very similar ideas.</p>

<p>“Still another proof of the plurality of tank inventors
is the fact that while one group of us were endeavoring
to interest the War Office in the idea, another group of
men, entirely ignorant of what we were doing, were trying
to get the Admiralty to take up a similar line of experimentation.
And it is no more than fair to point out
that the first money provided for experimentation with
landships, as we called them, came from Winston Spencer
Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty. But
he was only one of a number of men who played parts
in the development of the finished engine. For example,
there were two men in particular who worked out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mechanical problems. I wish I could give you their
names, but I cannot.”</p>

<p>To the suggestion of the writer in <i>The Post</i> that it
seemed strange that so many minds should have been
working out the same idea at the same time, Colonel
Swinton replied emphatically:</p>

<p>“Not when you consider the situation. The tank,
after all, is merely an elaboration, the last word, of
military devices as old as the history of military engineering.
Its ancestors were the armored automobile,
the belfry or siege tower on wheels of the middle ages,
and the Roman <i>testudo</i>. The need for the tank became
apparent to many who studied the military problems
demonstrated on the Western front. That is often so in
the history of inventions, you know. A given problem
occupies many minds simultaneously, and generally
several reach a solution about the same time, even though
perhaps one receives the credit for the invention above
all the others.”</p>

<p>“You spoke about the mechanical problems of the
tanks. What were they?”</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are getting on delicate ground. I am
glad to tell you all I can about the tanks, but I can’t
describe them—not beyond a certain point, that is. I
will say just this—the peculiar original feature of them,
upon which their efficiency most depends, is the construction
of their trackage. It is the feature which enables
them not only to negotiate rough and broken ground, but
to surmount obstacles and knock down trees and houses.
But the full description of the tanks cannot be written
until after the war.”</p>

<p>Colonel Swinton described the uproarious mirth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
British infantry on that morning when they had their
first sight of the unwieldy tanks clambering over
trenches, hills, small forests, and houses, spitting flames
as they rolled, lolloping forward like huge armored monsters
of the prehistoric past.</p>

<p>“It gave our men quite a moral lift,” he said. “They
forgot their troubles. But they soon came to see that
the tanks were more than funny, for wherever they attacked
the infantry had comparative immunity from
machine gun fire, and it is the German machine gun fire
which always has been the principal obstacle for our
troops.”</p>

<p>The name of the tank Colonel Swinton explained was
originally a bit of <i>camouflage</i>. People who saw them
in the process of erection variously described them as
snowplows for the Russian front and water tanks for the
armies in Egypt. The latter name stuck. And it may
not be generally known that this mechanical beast of
war is divided into two sexes.</p>

<p>“Some tanks are armed with small guns firing shells,”
said Colonel Swinton. “These are used especially
against machine gun nests. They are popularly known
in the tank unit as males. Other tanks carry machine
guns and are intended primarily for use against enemy
infantry. They are the females. There is no difference
in the construction.”</p>

<p>Colonel Swinton was detailed from his post in the
British War Cabinet to act as assistant to Lord Reading
in his mission to the United States to tighten the bonds
of efficiency between the two countries in their war
programs.</p>

<p>During the fall of 1914, Colonel Swinton was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
English official eye-witness of the fighting in Flanders
and France. Before that he was perhaps best known to
the general public as a writer of romances in which was
skillfully woven the technique of war. One of his
stories, “The Defense of Duffer’s Drift,” is used as a
text-book at West Point.</p>

How would you like to fly among the clouds a mile high
and drop a few bombs down on the Germans?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t in no special hurry to fly, Cap,” the negro

<h2>TAKING MOVING PICTURES UNDER
SHELL-FIRE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TAKING moving pictures while exploding shells
from pursuing warships and torpedo-boats are
sending up geysers that splash your fleeing launch and
stall the motor is a little out of the run of even an American
war correspondent’s daily stunt. Capt. F. E. Kleinschmidt,
who has been billeted with the Austrian marine
forces at Trieste, has recently had such an experience
while accompanying an expedition to the Italian coast
to remove a field of mines, an occupation quite dangerous
enough without the shell-fire. He tells this story in the
St. Louis <i>Post-Dispatch:</i></p>

<p>Captain M——, commander of the marine forces of
Trieste, had told me I should hold myself ready at a
moment’s notice for an interesting adventure. Presuming
it would be another airplane flight over the enemy’s
territory, I kept my servants and chauffeur up late, and
then finally lay down, fully dressed, with cameras and
instruments carefully overhauled and packed. At seven
o’clock next morning the boatswain of the launch <i>Lena</i>
called at the hotel and told me to follow him. “The
captain,” he said, “could not accompany me.” But he
had instructions to take me out to sea and then obey my
orders. An auto took us to the pier, where a fast little
launch was ready. This time she had a machine gun,
with ready belt attached, mounted in her stern, and flew
the Austrian man-of-war flag. Not until we were well
out to sea did the boatswain tell me we were to sneak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
over to the Italian shore and demolish a hostile mine
field. The prevailing fog and exceptionally calm
weather made it an ideal day to accomplish our purpose.
The fog prevented the Italians from seeing us, and the
calm sea made it possible to lift and handle the mines
with a minimum of danger to ourselves. Two tugboats
and a barge had already preceded us early in the morning.
After an hour’s run the three vessels suddenly appeared
before us, and we drew alongside the tugboat
No. 10, already busy hoisting a mine. I jumped aboard
and reported to Captain K——, in charge of the expedition.</p>

<p>To my chagrin he refused to let me stay. The first
reason was, it was too dangerous work, and he would not
take the responsibility of my being blown up; and, secondly,
we might be surprized by the Italians at any moment
and be sent to the bottom of the sea. All my arguing
and insisting upon the orders from his superior
proved useless. He insisted upon my return or written
orders clearing him of all responsibility. So I had to
go back in the launch to Trieste and report to Captain
M—— about the scruples of the commander of the mine
expedition. I also offered to leave my servants (two
Austrian soldiers) ashore and sign a written waiver of
all responsibility should anything happen to me.</p>

<p>The ever-generous and obliging Captain M—— said
he would accompany me himself, so out we raced for the
second time, and I had the satisfaction to stay and photograph.
The most dangerous work, namely, the lifting
of the first mine, had been accomplished during my return
to Trieste. The nature of the beast had been
ascertained. The construction was a new one, of the defensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
type. With good care and a smooth sea, the
mines could be hoisted, made harmless and be saved.
There would be, he hoped, no explosions, and, working
quietly, we would not draw an Italian fleet down upon us.</p>

<p>There are mines of offensive and defensive purposes—such
as you lay in front of your own harbors to protect
you, and such as you lay in front of the doors of your
enemy. The first ones you might want to move again;
therefore, they are so constructed that you can handle
them again, provided you know the secret of construction.
The other kind you don’t expect to touch again,
and they are, therefore, so constructed that anyone who
tampers with them will blow himself up. Secondly,
should the Italians surprize us, there would be little
chance for us to escape. We could steam only about ten
knots an hour, while any cruiser or torpedo could steam
over twenty. The only armament we had was one 75-millimeter
Hotchkiss gun in the bow. There would be
no surrender, either. He would blow the barge and
his own steamer up first.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, pointing to a tin can the size of a
tomato can, with ready short fuse attached, “is the bomb
to be thrown in the barge, and here,” looking down into
the forward hold, “is the other one, ready to blow us into
eternity. Now, if you want to stay, you’re welcome; if
not, take the launch back to Trieste.”</p>

<p>Capt. M——, after a brief inspection, went back with
the launch to Trieste, while I stayed and photographed
with the moving picture camera.</p>

<p>There is a long international law governing the laying
and exploding of mines, and there has been considerable
controversy about the unlawful laying of anchored and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
drifting mines. There are land-, river-, and sea-mines.
Mines laid for the protection of harbors are usually exploded
by electric batteries from an observing officer on
shore. Others are exploded by contact. The mechanical
devices to accomplish this are manifold. The policy adhered
to is usually to construct a mine so as to incur the
least danger, when handling them, to yourself, and with
the opposite results to your enemy. This holds true
as long as the secret of construction can be kept from
the enemy. The Italians on a night invasion had
dropped mines on the Austrian coast that would explode
when tilted only at an angle of twenty-five degrees. A
little vial of acid would spill over and explode the charge.
One day, when a heavy sea was running, some of the
mines exploded, betraying the location of the mine field,
and the Austrians “killed” the rest of them with minesweepers.</p>

<p>Mine fields are discovered by shallow-draft steamers
looking for them in clear water or dragging for
them. The aeroplane is also an excellent scout.
From a height of 1,000 feet he can look a good
depth into the sea and see a mine or submarine. On my
flight over Grado, on the Italian coast, I could see a
mine field and all shallows of a channel wonderfully
well from a height of 6,000 feet. When the hydroplane
sees a mine an automatic float is dropped that marks the
locality, and the mines boat comes along and either lifts
it or blows it up.</p>

<p>Here these Italian mines were of a late and very expensive
construction. They consisted of three parts—the
mine, the anchor, and a 100-pound weight; all three
connected with a wire cable. The weight is an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
oval lump of iron, attached by a cable to the anchor.
The anchor is a steel cylinder; the upper part is perforated;
the lower half is a tank with a hole in the bottom
and sides to allow the water to enter and sink it.
The mine is a globe two and one-half feet in diameter,
which fits into the barrel-like anchor up to its equator.</p>

<p>The weight, cable, and anchor holding the mine are
rolled from the mine-laying ship, overboard. The
weight sinks to the bottom, holding the mine in the spot.
Next, the water entering the tank slowly fills it, and it
sinks at the designated place. The mine, being
buoyant, has detached itself from the sinking anchor
and is pulled down with the anchor and floats now
at a depth of eight to twelve feet from the surface.
The water now dissolves a peculiar kind of cement that
has held a number of pistons. The pistons, being released,
spring out and snap in place all around the
equator of the mine. Comes a vessel in contact with
the mine, these protruding points, made of brittle metal,
break off and a spring releases a cartridge with explosive.
This cartridge, with a detonating cap on the bottom,
drops upon a point and explodes the initial charge,
which again explodes the charge in the mine.</p>

<p>In lifting the mine a rowboat with three men rows
up over the mine, and by means of a tube shutting off the
refraction of the light rays a person can look into the
water. With a boat-hook and attached rope, a shackle
on the top of the mine is caught, the pole unscrewed, the
rope is taken into a winch aboard the steamer or barge,
and the mine is then carefully hoisted. When the mine
comes to the surface the mine engineer rows up, presses
down a lever, and secures it with a steel pin. This performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
locks the spring and prevents the cartridge
from dropping on the piston. Next, the mine is hoisted
on the barge, the top is unscrewed, and the cartridge
holding the initial explosive charge is taken out, rendering
the mine harmless with ordinary handling. The
cylinder-like anchor is then hoisted by the attached
cable, and last the weight is brought up.</p>

<p>We were busy hoisting and searching for mines till 3
p. m. Another tugboat, the <i>San Marco</i>, was also steaming
around in our vicinity, keeping a sharp lookout for
hostile men-of-war, and also, when seeing a mine, dropping
a float. The fog had lifted a little, and once in a
while we could see the outlines of houses on the shore.
We had six mines on the barge and three on our steamer,
when the launch which had taken me out hove in sight
to take me back for dinner. Captain K—— said:
“Well, we have been lucky so far; we have only one more
mine to take up, and I had a good mind to blow it up and
hike for home.”</p>

<p>“Good,” I said, “then I’ll unpack my cameras again
and take a picture of the explosion.” At this moment the
<i>San Marco</i> gave a signal of three short blasts. I looked
toward the Italian coast and saw two men-of-war loom
up in the fog; then two more. Two had four funnels
each and were cruisers; the other two were torpedo-boat
destroyers.</p>

<p>“Enemy in sight.” “Clear the ship.” “Jump aboard.”
“Cut the barge adrift,” came in sharp commands from
Captain K——.</p>

<p>Six men at the windlass were lowering a mine carefully
onto the deck of the barge. They let it drop so
suddenly that the men guiding it jumped aside in terror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
All hands jumped from the barge aboard our steamer.
The ropes holding the barge alongside were cut, the bells
clanged in the engine-room, and we shot ahead. Fog
had momentarily blotted the vessels out again and gave a
false sense of security. “Make the towing hawser fast;
we’ll tow her,” shouted K——. Three men tried to belay
the hawser, but we had too much headway on already,
and the rope tore through their fingers.</p>

<p>“Throw the bomb into her.”</p>

<p>The bomb flew across, but fell short; then I saw a flash
of lightning in the fog, and the next moment a huge
fountain of water rose on our starboard side, and the
shell flew screaming past us. Boom! boom! boom! Now
all four ships gave us their broadsides and the stricken
sea spouted geysers all around us and the <i>San Marco</i>.
Screaming shells and roaring guns filled the fog.</p>

<p>“Twelve hundred meters,” quoth K——. “They
should soon get the range.” I looked at our little Hotchkiss
on the fore deck—there was no use to reply even.
The <i>San Marco</i> had described a half-circle and came
running up astern of us as if, like a good comrade, she
was going to share our fate with us. As she came
abreast of our Barge K—— shouted, “Drop a bomb into
her.”</p>

<p>“I have only one ready for my own ship,” the captain
yelled back.</p>

<p>“They will get our whole day’s work,” growled
K——.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” we all shouted the next minute, as a shell
struck the barge full center, exploding the six mines and
shattering it in bits, enveloping all in a dense cloud of
black smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the other launch came alongside and
raced along with us. I threw my cameras into it, and
jumped aboard; then we sheared off again, so as not to
give the enemy too big a target.</p>

<p>Next minute three shells shrieked so close to our ears
that we threw ourselves flat in the bottom of the launch
and one shaved the deck of No. 10. There seemed to be
no escape. The Italians cut us off from Trieste, and we
headed for Miramar. They did not come nearer; but the
Lord knows they were near enough, and by rights they
should have sent us to the bottom the first three shots.
Even had they steamed directly up to us, they could have
got us by the scruff of the neck in five minutes, for we
could make only ten knots to their twenty-five.</p>

<p>One fast torpedo-boat, risking what was a few hours
ago their own mine field, and, of course, knowing nothing
to the contrary, got the No. 10 and our launch in line
and gave us all attention in the manner of a pot-hunter
trying to rake us. I had just taken my moving picture
camera out of its case and set it on the tripod when a
shell struck three feet from the launch, raising a big
geyser. The column of water descending douched us
and stopped our motor. I had to dry off the spark plugs
while the engineer got busy cranking.</p>

<p>Happily, the motor sprang right on again, and I got
back to the camera and commenced cranking. I tried
to keep the No. 10 and the <i>San Marco</i> in the view-finder
in case they should get hit, and endeavored to get
the spouting of the shells. I got about one hundred feet
of it, but it is a tame illustration of all the excitement of
a race between life and death. The Italians with their
speed, having passed us, now swung around again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
edged us off from Miramar, so we held to the west of it
for our shore batteries.</p>

<p>All this time we kept wondering why the next shell
didn’t strike one of us. Then we saw one of our submarines
just diving to the periscope. By this time we
came nearly within range of our shore batteries, and one
of them began to bark at the Italians, but at such range
and in the fog they must have just tried to scare them,
for we couldn’t even see the shells hitting the water.
However, we escaped “by the skin of our teeth.”</p>

<p>As the fog had lifted a little around noon, and we
could see the houses on shore, evidently the lookouts had
reported our presence and the Italians had left Grado to
tackle us. The obscurity of the fog, the strange-looking
barge, the <i>San Marco</i>, the proximity of the mine fields,
all this had rendered the Italians so cautious that they
were satisfied to run parallel with us and give us their
broadside. The last we saw of them was when they
swung more and more around toward their own coast
and were again enveloped in the fog. They were the
same four vessels that had bombarded us the day before,
when I flew with Lieut. D—— in a hydroplane over
Grado.</p>

<h2>WEIGHTY MEASURES INVOLVING
UNCLE SAM’S NAVY</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THIS is the story of a conspiracy against Uncle Sam—a
patriotic plot to be sure, for it is concerned
with the son of a Spanish War veteran who was rejected
for service in Uncle Sam’s Navy because he was seven
pounds shy of weight for height, the said son’s up-and-down
dimension being full six feet. It is a story of
superfeeding conducted while the young man was skillfully
kept a prisoner—albeit a willing one, but just to
guard against his “jumping his feed”—by placing his
nether garments carefully under lock and key. The
New York <i>Sun</i> tells the tale and its happy outcome. It
happened in this way:</p>

<p>Young Walter Francis everlastingly did want to get
into the Navy and stop this <i>U</i>-boat nonsense once and
for all. Wherefore last Saturday bright and early
Potential Admiral Francis took his bearings from the
compass he wears on his watch chain, yelled, “Ship
ahoy!” to the skipper of a passing Brooklyn trolley car,
boarded a starboard seat well aft in the car, and then
set sail over the waves of Brooklyn asphalt toward the
recruiting plant of the Second Naval Battalion of Brooklyn
at the foot of Fifty-second street, Bay Ridge.</p>

<p>“Step on,” directed the examining surgeon to young
Mr. Francis, indicating the scales in his office. “Step off.
Now step out—you’re seven pounds shy for a six-footer.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Walter Francis, dejected and forlorn,
appeared before his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Smatter, son?” inquired the Spanish War vet.</p>

<p>“’Smatter, pop! There’s seven pounds the matter!
Uncle Sam can do without me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Francis came into the room and heard the depressing
news of her short-weight son, and straightway
conspiracy stalked silently upon the scene. Says the
writer in the <i>Sun:</i></p>

<p>A moment later a significant look passed between
father and mother above and back of the bowed head of
their son. Mr. and Mrs. Francis withdrew to the kitchen
for a council of war. Then Spanish-American War
Veteran Joe Francis walked into the front room again
and stood before his underweight offspring.</p>

<p>“Take off our pants, Walter,” said Francis, senior,
“And give me your—don’t sit there staring at me; get
busy—give me your shoes. Ma, catch the boy’s pants
when I throw ’em out to you. Lock his pants and shoes
up with all his other pants and then start in cooking.
Cook up everything you got in the house. And when you
get a chance run down to Gilligan’s and tell him to send
up five pounds of dried apples.”</p>

<p>“I’m on, pop!” suddenly shouted Embryo Admiral
Walter Francis, springing to his feet alive once more.
“You’re going to feed me up for a couple of weeks so I’ll
make the weight. Gosh, you’re there with the bean, pop—I
never woulda thought of the scheme.”</p>

<p>“For a couple of weeks!” cried Parent Francis scornfully.
“For a couple of days, you mean, son. Come on
into the dining-room and start right in to——. No, stay
right where you are. Don’t move from now on unless
you have to or you might lose another ounce. You just
sit right there all day. Ma will do the cooking and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
be the waiter. And if you’re not up to weight inside of
three days then I’m a German spy. And don’t weaken.
Just keep in mind that even if you do it won’t get you
anything. For I’m going to keep the key to all your
pants right in my pocket till you cripple the weighing
scales. So all you’re going to do from now on is stick
around and eat.”</p>

<p>Already Mrs. Francis had passed into the room a
nightshirt and a three-quart pitcher brimming with
sparkling Croton. Without a pause Parent Francis
had filled a tumbler and passed it on to his offspring,
who eagerly drained the glass. Tumbler after tumbler
of water was tumbled into the digestive system of the
underweight linotyper, while steadily from the kitchen
came the happy sizzling of four pork chops and fast-frying
potatoes with trimmings.</p>

<p>Twenty-one glasses of water disappeared into young
Walter Francis before Saturday’s sun had set, together
with all the pork chops, the fried potatoes, thick slices
of buttered bread, and some other snacks.</p>

<p>The Sunday treatment included fourteen glasses of
water and a general packing-in of fattening fodder,
until dinner-time arrived, when son Walter was fed
up on two pounds of steak smothered in boiled potatoes
with trimmings of stewed corn and mashed turnips, all
resting on a solid foundation of well-buttered bread and
roofed with a generous slab of apple pie. And then:</p>

<p>One and one-quarter pounds of mutton-chops merely
formed the architectural approaches to the breakfast
Walter Francis found staring him in the face when he
arose heavily on Monday morning. Ham and eggs in
groups—salty ham which hadn’t been parboiled, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
retaining its thirst-arousing properties—was the centerpiece
around which the luncheon Mrs. Francis had prepared
that day for her son was draped. A dinner that
ran all the way from soup to nuts (the time was growing
short if Parent Francis was to make good on his
promises) followed on Monday night, the big noise of
the Monday dinner being a sirloin steak.</p>

<p>And just before Son Francis decided to call it a day
and waddle to bed Spanish-American War Veteran
Francis had a final happy thought. Father fed son a
plentiful supply of dried apples and then unleashed a
growler and went down to the corner and got a quart
of collarless beer. Walter Francis flooded the dried
apples with the entire quart of beer, cried “Woof!
I’m a hippopotamus!” and collapsed into bed.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning last Father and Mother Francis
personally helped their son toward the street-door after
he had breakfasted on five pork-chops, two cups of
coffee and four rolls. Once more he was about to set
sail for the Second Naval Battalion recruiting office at
the foot of Fifty-second Street, where three days earlier
he had been turned down as hopelessly shy on tonnage.
Parent Francis helped his bouncing boy aboard the
trolley-car, shouting a last word of caution to walk, not
run, to the nearest entrance to the recruiting station.</p>

<p>And just before young Mr. Francis applied again for
the job of ridding the seas of <i>U</i>-boats (it should be
mentioned incidentally that about half an hour earlier
his father had unlocked a pair of pants and other gent’s
furnishings for the trip) the potential admiral saw the
burnished sign on a corner saloon. He got off the car
carefully, drank seven glasses of water in the saloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and then eased his way into the presence of the surgeon
who had given him the gate on Saturday.</p>

<p>“I told you before you were many pounds underweight,
young man,” said the surgeon. “It’s utterly
useless for you to come around here when——”</p>

<p>“But that was away last week, Doc,” wheezed young
Mr. Francis. “Give me another try at your scales.”</p>

<p>“My Gordon!” cried the surgeon, glancing at the
scales and uttering his favorite cuss-word. “Saturday
you were seven pounds under weight and to-day you’re
a pound overweight! How’d yuh ever do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of lads getting their teeth pulled to get
out of serving Uncle Sam, but you’re the first guy I ever
heard of who made a fool of his stummick to get into
the Navy,” grinned Bos’n Carroll as Walter Francis
bared his brawny arm for the vaccine. “Welcome to
our ocean, Kid!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>NEVER TALK BACK</h3>

<p>“——and then the Germans charged, and the captain
shouted, ‘Shoot at will,’ and I shouted, ‘Which one is
he?’ And then they took away my gun, and now I
can’t play any more.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h2>ENLISTED MEN TELL WHY THEY
JOINED THE ARMY</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">OUR first forces in France were volunteers, part of
the old regular Army, though many of the enlistments
were recent. The motives leading men to join
such an army are varied and in many cases humorous
or pathetic. A Y. M. C. A. secretary in France, who
had won the confidence of the men with whom he was
associated, wondered why each man had come. So he
arranged that they should hand in cards telling why
they had enlisted. Mr. Arthur Gleason presents some
of the answers in the New York <i>Tribune</i> as “the first
real word from the soldier himself of why he has offered
himself.” These replies came from two battalions of
an infantry regiment, which, for military reasons can
not be identified. Mr. Gleason puts them in several
groups. One is the sturdily patriotic. Thus, one
soldier says:</p>

<p>“My reason in 1907 was that I liked the service and
wanted to try for something new and bright for my
country.”</p>

<p>Others say: “Because my country needs me”; “to
catch Villa”; “I wanted to get the Kaiser’s goat”; “for
the benefit of the American Army”; “so patriotic and
didn’t know what it was”; “Mexican trouble, 1917”;
“I felt like my country needed me, and I wanted to
do something for it, and that was the only way I was
able to do anything for my dear country, the good old
U. S. A.”; “I never did anything worth while on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
outside, so I dedicated myself to my country that I
might be of some use to some one”; “a couple of Germans”;
“to serve God and my country.”</p>

<p>Another class of answers deal with what is in the
blood of youth—the desire to taste adventure, to see
the world, and see France. Here are a few in this
group:</p>

<p>“To do my duty and see the world”; “to see the
world, ha! ha!”; “because I thought I would like that
kind of a life, and didn’t know what kind of a life I
would have to lead in this hole”; “got tired of staying
at home”; “I was seeking adventure and change of
environments”; “to kill time and fight”; “to see
France”; “I was discouraged with the civilian life and
wanted to get some excitement”; “to have a chance to
ride on the train; I never had ridden”; “they said I was
not game and I was, and because I wished to”; “because
I wouldn’t stay in one place any length of time, I
thought if I joined the Army for three or seven years
I would be ready to settle down. I think that is as
good a thing as any boy could do”; “to see the world”;
“I had tried everything else, so I thought I would try
the Army.”</p>

<p>Another group of answers deal with the individual
human problem of hunger and loneliness. These that
follow illustrate this:</p>

<p>“To fight, and for what money was in it”; “three
good square meals and a bath”; “because I was disgusted
with myself and thought it would make a man
out of me”; “I was too lazy to do anything else”; “I
was stewed”; “to get some clothes, a place to sleep and
something to eat”; “because I was hungry”; “because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
I was nuts with the dobey heat” (dobey is a Mexican
slang word brought up by the boys from the border);
“because I had to keep from starving;” “in view of the
fact that I was so delicate and a physical wreck I
joined the Army, hoping to get lots of fresh air and
exercise, which I have sure gotton, and am ready to go
home at any time”; “I was in jail and they came and
got me. Hard luck!”; “because I did not have no
home”; “I got hungry”; “pork and beans were high at
the time”; “three square meals a day and a flop.”</p>

<p>The voice of State rights speaks in the replies of two
men from the South:</p>

<p>“To represent the State of Kentucky.”</p>

<p>“In answer to a call from my State, Mississippi, and
to see something of the world, and I have seen some of
the world, too.”</p>

<p>Then, too, there are a number that refuse to be
classified; each has its own note of suffering or audacity
of humor:</p>

<p>“To catch the Kaiser”; “because the girls like a
soldier”; “because my girl turned her back on me, that’s
all”; “I thought I was striking something soft, but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">...”; “the dear ones at home”; “I was crazy”; “two</span><br />
reasons: because girls like soldiers and I saw a sign
‘500,000 men wanted to police up France’”; “for my
health and anything else that is in it” (a consumptive
soldier); “to show that my blood was made of the American’s
blood”; “to learn self-control”; “it was a mistake;
I didn’t know any better”; “for my adopted
country”; “I got drunk on Saturday, the Fourth of
July, 1913, and I left home on the freight-train and
joined the Army, and woke up the next morning getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
two sheets in the wind, and I haven’t got drunk since
that; made a man out of me”; “to keep from working,
but I got balled”; “I have not seen anything yet but
rain”; “because I didn’t know what I was doing”;
“to kill a couple of Germans for the wrong done
Poland”; “to keep from wearing my knuckles out on the
neighbors’ back doors”; “adventure and experience;
also, to do my little bit for my country, the good old
U. S. A., and the Stars and Stripes, the flag of freedom”;
“to fight for my country and the flag, for the
U. S. is a free land, and we will get the Kaiser, damn
him. Oh, the U. S. A.!” (Picture of a flag.)</p>

<p>One man makes out a complete category of his
reasons: (<i>a</i>) “To see excitement”; (<i>b</i>) “to help win this
war and end the Kaiser’s idea of world ruler”; (<i>c</i>) “help
free the German people from Kaiserism.”</p>

<p>And, finally, there is one that needs no comment, and
with this we will end:</p>

<p>“Because mother was dead and I had no home.”</p>

<h2>TOMMY ATKINS, RAIN-SOAKED AND
WAR-WORN STILL GRINS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">FREDERIC WILLIAM WILE, one of the Vigilantes,
differs with Sherman in declaring that
war is mud. He had just returned from what he
describes as one of the periodical joy-rides which the
British Foreign Office and the General Staff organize
from time to time to give civilians an opportunity to
visit the front. Mr. Wile’s visits occurred when the
war-god was evidently taking a much-needed rest, for
he says that on two occasions when he intruded upon
Armageddon he saw more rain than blood spilled. But
he found Tommy Atkins—mud-caked and rain-soaked—still
wearing the grin that won’t come off. Mr. Wile
thus writes of his last visit:</p>

<p>I am in to-night from a day in the trenches. It rained
all the time. The trenches were gluey and sticky, and
the “duck-boards” along which we traveled were afloat
a good share of the day. But the only people who
used really strong language about having to eat, sleep,
and navigate in such soggy territory was our party of
civilian tenderfoots. The cave-dwellers in khaki whom
we encountered in endless numbers were as happy as
school-children on a picnic. Clay-spattered from head
to foot, their clothes often wringing wet, they looked
up from whatever happened to be their tasks and
grinned as we passed.</p>

<p>Our chief and always dominating impression was of
their grins and smiles. I am firmly convinced that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
soldiers who can laugh in such weather can not be
overcome by anything, not even the Prussian military
machine. Perhaps Tommy smiled more broadly than
usual to-day at our expense, for during our hike from
a certain quarry to a certain front line “Fritz” sent
over whiz-bangs which caused us arm-chair warriors
from home to duck and dodge in the most un-Napoleonic
fashion, even though our gyrations were in
obedience to nature’s first law—self-preservation.</p>

<p>When you’re in a trench and a shell screeches through
the heavens—you always hear it and never see it—the
temptation to side-step is the last word in irresistibility.
You have been provided with a steel helmet before
starting out on the expedition in view of the possibility
that a stray piece of German shrapnel may come your
way. These helmets have saved many a gallant Tommy
from sudden death.</p>

<p>After you’ve heard a whiz-bang and find that you
are still intact, you ask: “Was that a <i>Boche</i> or one of
ours?” You experience an indefinable sense of relief
when you are told that it was “one of ours,” but you
keep on ducking in the same old way whenever the
air is rent.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the invincible grin of Tommy Atkins in
abominable atmospheric surroundings and in the omnipresent
shadow of death that has photographed itself
most indelibly on my memory to-day. But next to that
I am struck by his amazing good health as mirrored by
his ruddy cheeks and bright eyes. Certainly the strapping
young fellows whom I have seen are a vastly finer,
sturdier lot, physically viewed, than any set of men
now running around the streets of London in citizens’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
clothes. It is manifestly “the life,” this endless sojourn
of theirs on the edge of No Man’s Land, with the enemy
a rifle-shot away.</p>

<p>You ask their officers what explains this hygienic
phenomenon—this ability to keep at the top note of
“fitness” amid privations almost unimaginable. You
will be told that it is the remorselessly “regular life”
the men lead for one thing, and the liberal supply of
fresh air, for another. Then it is the simple food they
eat and the never-ending exercise they get for their legs
and arms and muscles. They sleep when and where
they can, in their clothes for weeks on end, never saying
“How-do-you-do?” to a bath-tub sometimes for many
days, though they shave each morning with religious
punctuality, even in the midst of a mighty “push.”
Cleanliness of physiognomy is as much a passion with
Mr. Atkins as his daily ablutions are to a pious Turk.
You will go far before you will find a cleaner-faced
aggregation of young men than the British Army in
the field.</p>

<p>Should you have any doubt as to what the physical
appearance of the men tells you, and ask an officer
how Tommy is standing the strain of the war, he
declares enthusiastically, “The men are simply splendid!”
And you hear from the men that the officers are
“top-hole.” But all that you will learn from the officers
on that subject is:</p>

<p>Regulation No. 1, when a man gets a commission
in the British Army, is: “Men first, officers next.” An
officer’s business, in other words, is to see that his men
are well looked after. If there is any time left when
he has done that, he may look after himself. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Tommy comes first. That is why the relations between
superior and subordinate in the mighty Citizens’ Army
of Britain are perfect in the highest degree. Duke’s
son and cook’s son are real pals. Class distinctions
are non-existent in the England that is the trenched
fields of France and Flanders.</p>

<p>“Just so we keep on livin’—that’s all we ask,” was
the sententious observations of a mud-clotted Yorkshireman
who backed against the slimy wall of a trench
to let us pass. We had asked him the stereotyped question—“Well,
Tommy, how goes it?” His answer was
unmistakably typical of the spirit which dominates the
whole army. The men are not happy to be there.
They long for the war to end. They do not put in
their time in the slush and rain cheering and singing.
They hanker for “Blighty.” They want to go home.
But not until the grim business that brought them to
France is satisfactorily finished. They want no Stockholm-made
peace. They are fighting for a knock-out.</p>

<p>I left behind me in London a lot of dismal, gloomy,
and down-hearted friends, candidates all for the Pessimists’
Club. I wish they could have hiked through the
trenches with me. It is the finest cure in the world
for the blues. It may thunder and pour day and night
in Trenchland, and the country may be a morass for
miles in every direction, but the sun of optimism and
confidence is always shining in the British Army’s
heart.</p>

<h2>SOMETHING NEW FOR THE MARINES</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“IF CORPORAL —— ever wrote a better story for
his newspaper than the one he has sent to us, I
should certainly like to read it.” This high praise comes
from Maj. W. H. Parker, head of the Marine Recruiting
Service in New York, and is bestowed upon a letter in
<i>The Recruiters’ Bulletin</i>, which was written by a marine,
formerly a reporter in Philadelphia and now “Somewhere
in France.” He rejoices at the start that “at
last it is happening,” which “happening” is that the
marines, “every scrapping one of them down to the last
grizzled veteran, are undergoing new experiences—learning
new tricks.” Of course this is beyond possibility,
everybody will say, and the ex-reporter admits
that—</p>

<p>One would think so after hearing of their experiences
in far-away China, Japan, and the Philippines,
near-by Cuba, Haiti, and Mexico, and other places which
God forgot and which you and I never heard of; after
hearing stories of daredevil bravery, fierce abandon
and disregard for life and limb in the faithful discharge
of their duties as soldiers of the sea and guardians of
the peace in Uncle Sam’s dirty corners.</p>

<p>And yet here in France, among people of their own
color and race, of paved streets and taxicabs, among the
old men and women of the villages, among the <i>poilus</i>
coming and going in a steady stream to and from the
front, the marine is learning new things every day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Packing up “back home” on a few hours’ notice is
no new experience to the marine. Marching aboard a
transport, with the date and hour of sailing unknown,
is taken as a matter of course by the veteran. There
is no cheering gallery, no weeping relatives, wife, or
sweethearts, as he leaves to carry out the business in
hand. It is just the same as if you were going to your
office in the morning. You may return in time for dinner
or you may be delayed. The only difference is that
sometimes the marines do not return.</p>

<p>Although life aboard the transport which carried the
first regiment of marines to new fields of action in
France was a matter of routine to the average sea-going
soldier, there was added the zest of expectation of an
encounter with one of the floating perils, the “sub.” It
was but a matter of two or three days, however, when
everyone became accustomed to the numerous lookouts
stationed about the ship, the frequent “abandon ship”
drills, the strange orders which came down the line, and
the new-fangled rules and regulations which permitted
no lights or smoking after sundown.</p>

<p>Kaiser “Bill’s” pet sharks were contemptuously referred
to as the “tin lizzies” of the sea. “We must play
safe and avoid them,” was the policy of those entrusted
with the safety of more than 2,000 expectant fighters,
however. And we met them, too. Not one or two of
them, but—(here the censor interfered.)</p>

<p>Since his arrival in France the marine has spent day
after day in learning new things, not the least of which
is that contrary to his usual experience of finding about
him a hostile people, rifle in hand, and unknown danger
ahead, he is among a people who welcome him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
friend and ally in the struggle against a common enemy.
With the arrival of the American troops, the appealing
outstretched hands of France were changed to hands of
welcome, creating an atmosphere that might easily have
turned the heads of men more balanced than the marines
after being confined for more than two weeks aboard a
ship, but—</p>

<p>Here, again, one comes in contact with the matter-of-fact
administration of the marines. Arriving under such
circumstances, the landing and encampment of the marines
were effected with a military precision and businesslike
efficiency which allowed no one for a moment
to forget the serious nature of the mission upon which
he had embarked.</p>

<p>Stores and supplies were loaded on trucks and, in
less than three hours after the order was given to disembark,
the marines, with their packs strapped over the
shoulders, were marching to their camp just on the outskirts
of the seaport town of ——. Within another hour
the whole regiment was under canvas, field-desks and
typewriter-chests were unlocked, and regimental and
other department offices were running along at full
swing.</p>

<p>And that was the beginning of the period of training
during which the marine is learning everything that is
to be known about waging twentieth-century warfare.
He is taking a post-graduate course in the intricacies of
modern trench-building, grenade-throwing, and barbed-wire
entanglements. And the very best men of the
French Army are his instructors.</p>

<p>The marine is also learning the “lingo” of this country,
the nicer phrases of the language as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
slang of the trenches. But in the majority of cases
experience was his teacher. Upon the arrival of the
transport liberty hours were arranged for the marines,
and, armed with a “Short Vocabulary of French Words
and Phrases,” with which all had been supplied, they
invaded the cafés, restaurants, and shops of the little
old seaport town.</p>

<p>And it was the restaurants where one’s ignorance of
French was most keenly felt. All sorts of queer and yet
strangely familiar noises emanated from the curtained
windows of the <i>buvettes</i> along the streets. Upon investigation
it would be discovered that a marine, having lost
his “vocabulary,” was flapping his arms and cackling for
eggs, earnestly baahing for a lamb stew, or grunting to
the best of his ability in a vain endeavor to make
<i>madame</i> understand that he wanted roast pork. Imagine
his chagrin to find that “pig” and “pork,” as shown on
page 16, are “<i>porc</i>” in French and are pronounced just
the same as in good old American. But the scenes that
presented themselves on Sundays or <i>fête</i> days—take the
4th or 14th of July, for example—were such as never
had been seen in any French town before. Picture a
tiny café, low and whitewashed, ancient, weather-beaten,
but immaculately clean, with its heavy ceiling-beams
and huge fireplace with brass and copper furnishings.
With this background imagine just as many tables as the
little place can hold about which are crowded French
and American soldiers, sailors, and marines.</p>

<p>The table in the corner there, for instance: two <i>poilus</i>,
two American “jackies,” two marines, and an old Breton
peasant farmer with his wife, fat, uncomprehending,
and wild-eyed, and his daughter, red-lipped and of fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
complexion—these three in from the country for a holiday,
the women arrayed in the black cloth and velvet
costumes, bright-colored silk aprons, and elaborate linen
head-dress which identify them as native of a certain
locality.</p>

<p>One of the “jackies” sings with gusto service songs
of strong and colorful language, singing to himself save
for the half-amused and wondering stares of the peasants.
The younger of the Frenchmen shows by taking
off his coat and unbuttoning his shirt where the shell-fragment
penetrated which caused the paralysis in his
left arm and sent him home on a month’s furlough, and
the Americans eye with interest the actual fragment
itself, now doing duty as a watch-charm.</p>

<p>But the hubbub and racket cease, and every one rushes
to the windows and door as the Marine Band comes
swinging along the water-front, playing with catching
rhythm “Our Director.” The French burst out in cries
of “<i>Vive l’Amérique!</i>” The fever spreads, and our
soldiers and sailors yell “<i>Vive la France!</i>” or as near to
it as they can get, as the procession marches by, and the
fat old peasant woman says with full approval, “That’s
beautiful!”</p>

<p>Another letter from the permanent training-camp of
the marines, published in <i>The Recruiters’ Bulletin</i>,
tells of an inspection of the regiment by General Pershing
and General Pétain, the French Commander-in-Chief.
We read “that the piercing eyes of ‘Black Jack’
rarely miss an unshaven face, badly polished shoes, or
the sloppy appearance of anyone” among the soldiers
under inspection, and the writer relates:</p>

<p>Together with the Commander-in-Chief of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
French forces and accompanied by several French generals,
representing the most important military units in
France, General Pershing made one of his now famous
whirlwind inspection tours and descended upon the
marines amid a cloud of dust which marked the line of
travel of the high-powered French touring-cars which
carried the generals. Not so very long before that the
field-telephone in the regimental office rang and a voice
came over the wire:</p>

<p>“The big blue machine is on the way down, and
will probably be there in ten minutes.” That was sufficient.
Two or three telephone-calls were hurriedly
made, and the Colonel, accompanied by his staff, proceeded
on “up the line,” met the General’s party, and
the marines were ready.</p>

<p>The result of the inspection is summed up in the
memorandum issued to the command and which says in
part: “Yesterday, at the inspection of the regiment by
General ——, Commander-in-Chief of all the French
forces, General Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the
American forces in France, and General ——, commanding
the —— Division Chasseurs, who are instructing
our men, General —— congratulated the Colonel
of our regiment on the splendid appearance of officers
and men as well as the cleanliness of the town. General
Pershing personally told the regimental commander that
he wished to congratulate him on having such an excellent
regiment.”</p>

<p>This announcement was read to the marines as they
were lined up for their noonday meal. And where is
the marine whose chest would not swell just a bit at
this tribute paid by General Pershing to those upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
whose shoulders rests the responsibility of maintaining
and perpetuating the glorious history and fine traditions
of the United States Marine Corps?</p>

<h3>NEW GROUNDS FOR EXEMPTION</h3>

<p>The two young girls watched the “nutty young Cuthbert”
pass along the street.</p>

<p>“Did he appeal for exemption?” said May.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ray, “you might have known he would.”</p>

<p>“On what grounds?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Ray, “unless it was upon the
ground that if he went to the war his wife’s father would

<h3>SOUSA’S LITTLE JOKE</h3>

<p>Lieut. John Philip Sousa, who is organizing military
bands for the navy, was talking to a correspondent about
the submarine danger.</p>

<p>“A friend of mine, a cornet virtuoso,” he said, “was
submarined in the Mediterranean. The English paper
that reported the affair worded it thus:</p>

<p>“‘The famous cornetist, Mr. Hornblower, though submarined
by the Germans in the Mediterranean, was able
to appear at Marseilles the following evening in four
pieces.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>RAPID MILITARY ADVANCEMENT</h3>

<p>A certain west end tailor, being owed a considerable
amount by a colonel who was received everywhere in
society, made a bargain with the gentleman. He stipulated
that instead of paying his debt, the colonel should
introduce himself and family into high society. To this
the colonel agreed and not long after the tailor received
an invitation to dinner.</p>

<p>When the tailor arrived in the full glory of a perfect
evening dress, the colonel did not recognize him.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my dear fellow,” he said quietly, as he
shook hands, “I quite forget your name!”</p>

<p>“Quite likely!” sneered the tailor, also sotto voce.
“But I made your breeches!”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” said the colonel, smiling. And then, turning
to his wife, said: “Allow me to introduce you, dear—Major
Bridges!”</p>

<p>(Spring of 1917.) The very newest, largest and
choicest collection of merry quips about our friend
the Ford car, all good-natured and laughable, with
nothing to offend even Mr. Henry Ford himself.
The author went to Detroit and obtained some of
the new jokes in this book right at the Ford factory.
You can’t help laughing, whether you own
a Ford car or not, at the funny things in “Ford
Smiles.” When you get this book of humor we ask
you to read the short Preface to it; it explains, in
the author’s opinion, why every good Ford joke
is a compliment to that great invention—the Ford
Motor Car. Probably you hadn’t thought of it that
way.</p>
